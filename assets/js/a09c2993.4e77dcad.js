But with Sequence Wallet, users don\'t have to have any MATIC tokens at all, instead they "sign" and "relay" their transactions through the Sequence Relayer service which will pay the MATIC gas on the user\'s behalf, and the user\'s relay transaction will automatically substitute the MATIC gas fee for one of ETH, USDC, or DAI (a users choice). This works like this across all networks, so a user only ever needs USDC and can pay for fees across all networks... a single gas token for any network.
