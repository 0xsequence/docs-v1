Technically, anyone can relay these transactions, but the current wallet interface does not allow users to change which relayer they want to use. In the future, we plan on offering more freedom on that front.\nSequence Relayers reprice their transaction every 2 or 3 blocks to ensure fast inclusion. This means users will never encounter stuck transactions and will not have to worry about managing gas prices. We plan on integrating an "instant" option for advanced users, but this is not yet available.']})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},7279:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o,a:()=>i});var s=n(959);const r={},a=s.createContext(r);function i(e){const t=s.useContext(a);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:i(e.components),s.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
