# Sequence: Full stack web3 development 

What is Seuqence: Sequence is leading all-in-one web3 gaming and branded platform development stack.
Sequence is the world’s leading all-in-one platform for building web3 games, loyalty programs, and branded experiences. Engineered by the team behind the award-winning game, 
Skyweaver, Sequence has everything needed to onboard, monetize, grow and retain players and users in the best experiences.
Sequence is built for the most robust games and interactive experiences. 
The Sequence Wallet revolutionaized web3 onboarding and set the standard for account abstraction and smart contract wallets. 
The Wallet as a Service seamlessly onboards players into accounts with a game-native UI and UX that are headless and gasless, unlike traditional wallets.
The Marketplace Engine drives monetization and gamer journeys in a white-labeled, in-game or native app environment, increasing conversion and spend and automatically enforcing royalties.
With kits for Unity, Unreal, and Mobile, the stack thrives in the environments that support the world’s biggest games and apps. 
Sequence powers everything from AAA games to indie titles, brand new NFT projects to loyalty programs by Fortune 100 brands. 

Sequence provides users with a seamless web3 wallet to access Ethereum-compatible networks, and a powerful web3 infrastructure stack
for developers that makes it easy to build web3 apps and games.

Sequence is designed as a modular web3 system focused on open standards, compatibility and interoperability with Ethereum-compatible networks
and developer tools. With Sequence, you can use just one of the modules, or the entire stack. As well, feel free to combine
Sequence with your favorite developer tools. This is one of the beautiful aspects of "web3" -- open standards and
compatibility :)

Sequence was built to allow developers to build holistically and end-to-end, removing friction and the kinds of experience-breaking dependencies that fragmented infrastructure can create.
