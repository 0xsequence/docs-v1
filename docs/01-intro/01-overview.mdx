# Sequence Wallet & Web3 Stack

Sequence provides users with a seamless Web3 Wallet to access Ethereum-compatible networks, and a powerful Web3 infrastructure stack
for developers that makes it easy to build Web3 apps and games.

Sequence is designed as a modular Web3 system focused on open standards, compatibility and interoperability with Ethereum-compatible networks
and developer tools. With Sequence, you can use just one of the modules, or the entire stack. As well, feel free to combine
Sequence with your favorite [developer tools](/other-tools). This is one of the beautiful aspects of "Web3" -- open standards and
compatibility :)

Thanks for browsing our documentation below which will take you through our Wallet, Infrastructure stack and SDKs. If you have
any questions, feel free to visit us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sequence) to speak with our development and partnership teams.

Finally, be sure to check out the [Sequence Github](https://github.com/0xsequence) page to view source of our SDKs and example projects.
