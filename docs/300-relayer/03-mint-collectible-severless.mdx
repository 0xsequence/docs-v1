# Mint a Collectible using a Gasless Serverless Relayer

Time to complete: 20-30 minutes

The Sequence Relayer can be implemented on a severless [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) worker so a game or app user interaction is seamless without a confirmation signature or gas payment. You'll also benefit from not having to be worried about transaction speed, throughput and re-orgs by the relayer, and experience automatic scaling with cloudflare.

The following steps will guide you through how to build your technology in 4 steps:

1. [Setup Cloudflare environment with wrangler cli & deploy a test](/relayer/mint-collectible-severless#1-setup-cloudflare-environment-with-wrangler-cli--deploy-a-test)
2. [Deploy & Sponsor an ERC1155 Contract with Builder](/relayer/mint-collectible-severless#2-deploy--sponsor-an-erc1155-contract-with-builder)
3. [Use EthAuthProof to prevent EOA DDoS](relayer/mint-collectible-severless#3-use-ethauthproof-to-prevent-eoa-ddos)
4. [Mint a collectible to wallet](relayer/mint-collectible-severless#4-mint-a-collectible-to-wallet)

The result, a secure API with the following specs:
* HTTPS GET: returns blockNumber
* HTTPS POST(proof, address): mints a collectible & returns transaction hash

:::info Difficulty
If you have knowledge of the cli, npm, and Sequence Builder, this guide is possible to complete.
:::

## 1. Setup Cloudflare environment with wrangler cli & deploy a test

In order to create the project from scratch, first create a project with `mkdir`, `cd` into the project, and run `pnpm init` to create a `package.json`.

Next, make sure wrangler cli is installed in your project and set the `wrangler` keyword as an alias in your local bash session.

```
pnpm install wrangler --save-dev
alias wrangler='./node_modules/.bin/wrangler'
```

Create an account on the [Cloudflare site](https://cloudflare.com/) and perform a login step to login to your cloudflare dashboard to connect the Cloudflare platform to your local development environment.

```
wrangler login
```

Once logged in, initialize the project in the directory by accepting one of the randomly generated project folder names provided that you like, and follow the prompts to initialize your git tracked typescript `"Hello World" Worker` application. 

```
wrangler init
```

To complete this step, you should press enter 4 times after `wrangler init` with the last step answered as `No` to decline deployment.

This will clone down a starter repository that can be used to deploy code to the cloud.

:::info Local API Testing
At any point in the guide, you can use the `wrangler dev` command in the project folder for local testing
:::

#### Deploy Test

Finally, `cd` into the randomly generated project folder, and perform a `wrangler deploy` command. 

This should print a URL, which you can enter in the browser the URL `https://<app>.<account>.workers.dev` to view the `Hello World!` result.

## 2. Deploy & Sponsor an ERC1155 Contract with Builder

First, follow [this guide](/guides/deploy-an-item-collection-contract) to deploy a contract.

And [this guide](/guides/sponsor-contract-gas-tank) in order to sponsor a contract.

Then, one must update the role access of the contract in the Builder to only receive requests from the minter wallet address, which can be done in 2 steps.

You can do this in Sequence Builder by providing `minter permission` to your `Sequence Wallet Relayer Address`. 

In order to know what the relayer address you are working with is, one must first either:

1. Have one generated for you using this [dapp](https://73eql-hyaaa-aaaad-qf5bq-cai.ic.fleek.co/) 
2. Or, you can print locally the account address produced from an EOA wallet private key using the following code snippet:

```ts
import { Session } from '@0xsequence/auth'
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

(async () => {

	// Generate a new EOA
	// const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom()
  	// const privateKey = wallet.privateKey

	// Or, use an existing EOA private key
	const privateKey = ''
	const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://nodes.sequence.app/mainnet')

	// Create your server EOA
	const walletEOA = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider)

	// Open a Sequence session, this will find or create
	// a Sequence wallet controlled by your server EOA
	const session = await Session.singleSigner({
		signer: walletEOA,
		projectAccessKey: 'access_key'
	})

	const signer = session.account.getSigner(1)
	console.log(`Your relayer wallet address: ${signer.account.address}`)

})()
```
To do so, open your project, navigate to the `Contracts` page, select your `Linked contracts` and under `Write Contract` tab expand the `grantRole` method. 

Complete with the following details:

`bytes32 role`: `0x9f2df0fed2c77648de5860a4cc508cd0818c85b8b8a1ab4ceeef8d981c8956a6`

`address account`: `Generated Sequence Relayer Wallet Address`

<img src='/img/relayer/grant_role.png' />

Where the `role` string inputted is the result of `keccak256("MINTER_ROLE")` in solidity or `ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes("MINTER_ROLE"))` in javascript

Finish by clicking `write` and sign the sponsored transaction.

## 3. Use EthAuthProof to prevent EOA DDoS

Now that we have a contract deployed, we can return to the cloudflare worker directory and project, and install `ethers` and `0xsequence` to get access to sequence APIs in order to perform a proof validation that the request is coming from a trusted source, a sequence wallet.

```
pnpm install 0xsequence @0xsequence/network
```

Then, we have to add a type of middleware, after we check if it's a POST or GET request. If it's a POST request, verify that the passed in `proofString` and `address` are valid, as well as the environment variables.  

The code scaffold placed into `src/index.ts` would look like this, with `callContract` and `getBlockNumber` mocked out, using the mentioned verification step of calling `verify` before any contract call.

```ts
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'
import { networks, findSupportedNetwork } from '@0xsequence/network'

export interface Env {
	PKEY: string; // Private key for EOA wallet
	CONTRACT_ADDRESS: string; // Deployed ERC1155 or ERC721 contract address
	PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY: string; // From sequence.build
	CHAIN_HANDLE: string; // Standardized chain name – See https://docs.sequence.xyz/multi-chain-support
}

// use the sequence api to verify proof came from a sequence wallet
const verify = async (chainId: string, walletAddress: string, ethAuthProofString: string): Promise<Boolean> => {
	const api = new sequence.api.SequenceAPIClient('https://api.sequence.app')
	const { isValid } = await api.isValidETHAuthProof({
		chainId, walletAddress, ethAuthProofString
	})
	return isValid
}

async function handleRequest(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
	if (env.PKEY === undefined || env.PKEY === '') {
		return new Response('Make sure PKEY is configured in your environment', { status: 400 })
	}

	if (env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS === undefined || env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS === '') {
		return new Response('Make sure CONTRACT_ADDRESS is configured in your environment', { status: 400 })
	}

	if (env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY === undefined || env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY === '') {
		return new Response('Make sure PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY is configured in your environment', { status: 400 })
	}

	if (env.CHAIN_HANDLE === undefined || env.CHAIN_HANDLE === '') {
		return new Response('Make sure CHAIN_HANDLE is configured in your environment', { status: 400 })
	}

	const chainConfig = findSupportedNetwork(env.CHAIN_HANDLE)

	if (chainConfig === undefined) {
		return new Response('Unsupported network or unknown CHAIN_HANDLE', { status: 400 })
	}

	// POST request
	if (request.method === "POST") {
		// parse the request body as JSON
		const body = await request.json();
		const { proof, address, tokenId }: any = body;
		try {
			// check that the proof is valid
			if(await verify(env.CHAIN_HANDLE, address, proof)){
				try{
					// mocked call
					const res = await callContract(request, env, address, tokenId)
					return new Response(`${res.hash}`, { status: 200 })
				} catch (err: any) {
					console.log(err)
					return new Response(`Something went wrong: ${JSON.stringify(err)}`, { status: 400 })
				}
			} else {
				return new Response(`Unauthorized`, { status: 401 })
			}
		} catch(err: any){
			return new Response(`Unauthorized ${JSON.stringify(err)}`, { status: 401 })
		}
	} 
	// GET request
	else {
		try {
			// mocked call
			const res = await getBlockNumber(env.CHAIN_HANDLE, request)
			return new Response(`Block Number: ${res}`)
		} catch(err: any){
			return new Response(`Something went wrong: ${JSON.stringify(err)}`, { status: 500 })
		}
	}
}

const getBlockNumber = async (chainId: string, request: Request): Promise<number> => {
	return chainId
}

const callContract = async (request: Request, env: Env, address: string, tokenId: number): Promise<ethers.providers.TransactionResponse> => {
	return { hash: "0x" } as any
}

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
		// Process the request and create a response
		const response = await handleRequest(request, env, ctx);

		// Set CORS headers
		response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
		response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS");
		response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type");

		// return response
		return response;
	}
};
```

#### Add cloudflare environment variables
Then, pass in the environment variables for your build by updating the `[vars]` section in your `wrangler.toml`.

```
[vars]
PKEY = "" # Private key for EOA wallet
CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "" # // Deployed ERC1155 or ERC721 contract address
PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY = "" # From sequence.build
CHAIN_HANDLE = "" # // Standardized chain name – See https://docs.sequence.xyz/multi-chain-support
```

#### Implement window object in wrangler template

It should be noted, if you try to deploy this you'll get a missing `window` object required by the web3 modules. 

To prevent this, add the following line to your `wrangler.toml` file to make the environment compatible.

```
...
node_compat = true # add this line
...
```

#### Testing the deploy

You can now redeploy using `wrangler deploy`

And perform a curl request to test your endpoint like such:

```
curl -X POST https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"proof": "someProof", "address": "someAddress", "tokenId": 0 }'

... invalid proof string ... 

# and if you replace with actual proof (from a wallet client login) and address on polygon, it should return 
success
```

You can acquire your wallet address proof by using this [dapp](https://73eql-hyaaa-aaaad-qf5bq-cai.ic.fleek.co/).

## 4. Mint a collectible to wallet

Finally, to deploy and mint a collectible from the sponsored contract address, we install the following packages 

```
pnpm install @0xsequence/auth ethers@5.7.2
```

and implement the `callContract` and `getBlockNumber` methods previously mocked out as follows:

```ts
import { ethers } from 'ethers'
import { Session, SessionSettings } from '@0xsequence/auth'

...

const getBlockNumber = async (chainId: string, request: Request): Promise<number> => {
	const nodeUrl = `https://nodes.sequence.app/${chainId}`
	const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider({ url: nodeUrl, skipFetchSetup: true })
	return await provider.getBlockNumber()
}

const callContract = async (request: Request, env: Env, address: string, tokenId: number): Promise<ethers.providers.TransactionResponse> => {

	const nodeUrl = `https://nodes.sequence.app/${env.CHAIN_HANDLE}`
	const relayerUrl = `https://${env.CHAIN_HANDLE}-relayer.sequence.app`
	const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider({ url: nodeUrl, skipFetchSetup: true })
    const contractAddress = env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS

    // create EOA from private key
	const walletEOA = new ethers.Wallet(env.PKEY, provider);

	// instantiate settings
	const settings: Partial<SessionSettings> = {
		networks: [{
			...networks[findSupportedNetwork(env.CHAIN_HANDLE)!.chainId],
			rpcUrl: findSupportedNetwork(env.CHAIN_HANDLE)!.rpcUrl,
			provider: provider,
			relayer: {
				url: relayerUrl,
				provider: {
					url: findSupportedNetwork(env.CHAIN_HANDLE)!.rpcUrl
				}
			}
		}],
	}

    // create a single signer sequence wallet session
	const session = await Session.singleSigner({
		settings: settings,
		signer: walletEOA,
		projectAccessKey: env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY
	})

	// get signer
	const signer = session.account.getSigner(findSupportedNetwork(env.CHAIN_HANDLE)!.chainId)
		
	// create interface from partial abi
	const collectibleInterface = new ethers.utils.Interface([
		'function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, bytes data)'
	])
	
	// create calldata
	const data = collectibleInterface.encodeFunctionData(
		'mint', [address, tokenId, 1, "0x00"]
	)

	// create transaction object
	const txn = { to: contractAddress, data }

	try {
		return await signer.sendTransaction(txn)
	} catch (err) {
		throw err
	}
}
```

Once these steps are complete, you can redeploy and test with the steps outlined in this [prior step](/relayer/mint-collectible-severless#testing), and this time the POST request should return a transaction hash for the completed mint and the GET request would return a block number.
