# Ethereum Compatibility

We ❤️ Ethereum

<img src='/img/eth-love.jpg' />

Our goal is to support the Ethereum ecosystem by building compatible systems and tools to extend the capabilities of any
Ethereum / EVM compatible blockchain network for builders and users alike. Our vision is that Ethereum is
no longer a single chain, but a network of chains designed around the EVM and Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoints.

Sequence is built to wrap itself around Ethereum chains and extend their capabilities, and offer
additional capabilities while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum protocols, standards and contracts.

Bring your own tools, combine them with Sequence, and help grow web3 by delivering new and amazing experiences
for users on the Web. Aka, sequence is compatible with all existing Ethereum web libraries such as [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/),
[web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), and all other contracts, libraries and products that
maintain compatibility with Ethereum standards.
