# Migrate to sequence-js v1.1.0 

This document explains how to migrate from sequence-js versions earlier than v1.1.0 to v1.1.0.

## Changes

### Init library

The `initWallet` function's `network` parameter has been replaced. Now, it accepts a configuration object that *may* include a `defaultNetwork` parameter.

Before:

```ts
const wallet = await sequence.initWallet('mainnet')
```

After:

```ts
const wallet = await sequence.initWallet({ defaultNetwork: 'mainnet' })
```

The parameter remains optional. If not provided, the default network will be `mainnet`.

### Wallet class instance

Previously, both `initWallet` and `getWallet` returned a `Wallet` instance, which could be used to access both a provider and a signer. Now, they return a `SequenceProvider`, which already functions as the provider while offering sequence-specific methods.

Methods such as `getSigner` and `getProvider` are still available in `SequenceProvider`. Note that calling `getProvider()` will return `self`.

Before:

```ts
const wallet = await sequence.initWallet('mainnet')
const provider = wallet.getProvider()
const signer = wallet.getSigner()
```

After:

```ts
const provider = await sequence.initWallet('mainnet')
const signer = provider.getSigner()
```

#### Custom network provider and signer

The `getProvider` and `getSigner` methods now accept an optional `network` parameter. This is handy when you wish to use a custom provider or signer for a specific network. In such cases, a tailored network provider/signer is created, and the method does **not** return `self`.

### Connect wallet

The `connect` function now mandates an `app` parameter, representing the app name requesting the connection. This name will be displayed to the user.

Before:

```ts
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect()
```

After:

```ts
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect({ app: 'Your app name' })
```

### Sign EIP-6492 messages

EIP-6492 allows the wallet to sign messages without first executing a transaction. This feature should be utilized only when the signature will be validated by software supporting EIP-6492, such as the sequence-js library. All `sign` methods of the signer use EIP-6492 by default.

To opt out of EIP-6492, previously you could append a `false` value at the end of each sign method; now you can pass an `eip6492` named argument.

Before:

```ts
const signature = await signer.signMessage(message, undefined, false)
```

After:

```ts
const signature = await signer.signMessage(message, { eip6492: false })
```

### Operate on a specific network

Earlier, most methods of the signer and provider would target the default network. You could alter this by adding a positional `network` argument at the end of each method. This has been swapped with a named `chainId` argument, which can be combined with other named arguments, such as `eip6492`.

Before:

```ts
const balance = await provider.sendTransaction(transaction, 'rinkeby')
```

After:

```ts
const balance = await provider.sendTransaction(transaction, { chainId: 'rinkeby' })
```

### Send batch transactions

Previously, separate methods (`sendTransactionBatch` and `sendTransaction`) were provided for batch transactions. Now, there's just `sendTransaction` that can receive either an array of transactions or a singular transaction.

Before:

```ts
const receipt1 = await provider.sendTransactionBatch([transaction1, transaction2])
const receipt2 = await provider.sendTransaction(transaction3)
```

After:

```ts
const receipt1 = await provider.sendBatchTransaction([transaction1, transaction2])
const receipt2 = await provider.sendBatchTransaction(transaction3)
```

### Removal of internal state methods

Some internal state methods have been either removed or deprecated. This encompasses methods for:

- Determining if the wallet is deployed
- Retrieving the wallet's "sequence context"
- Accessing the "inner configuration" of the wallet (i.e., its comprising signers)

Should you require any of these methods, please reach out to [support](./support).

### Rainbowkit Connector

Compatibility with the Rainbowkit connector has been largely retained. However, the configuration for `defaultNetwork` has been relocated. Previously, it was set under `connect.networkId`. Now, it has been elevated to a top-level property named `defaultNetwork`.

Before:

```ts
sequenceWallet({
  chains,
  connect: {
    app: 'Demo app',
    networkId: 1,
  },
})
```

After:

```ts
sequenceWallet({
  chains,
  defaultNetwork: 1,
  connect: {
    app: 'Demo app',
  },
})
```

#### Wagmi Connector

The Wagmi connector has undergone the same modifications as the Rainbowkit connector.

Before:

```ts
new SequenceConnector({
  chains,
  connect: {
    app: 'Demo app',
    networkId: 1,
  },
})
```

After:

```ts
new SequenceConnector({
  chains,
  defaultNetwork: 1,
  connect: {
    app: 'Demo app',
  },
})
```

### Rainbowkit & Wagmi Connector - EIP-6492 Signatures

In earlier versions, EIP-6492 signatures were activated globally either through the `useEIP6492` configuration property or the `useSequenceEIP6492` method. Both methods have now been deprecated. Attempting to initialize with `useEIP6492` will result in a runtime error.

For utilizing EIP-6492 in the updated version, you'll need to explicitly invoke `sequence_sign` or `sequence_signTypedData_v4` on the connector.

Before:

```ts
new SequenceConnector({
  chains,
  connect: {
    app: 'Demo app',
    networkId: 1,
    useEIP6492: true,
  },
})
```

After:

```ts
// NOTE: The connector is now initialized without the useEIP6492 property.
// ...
const sig = await walletClient.request({
  method: 'sequence_sign',
  params: [message, account]
}) as string;
```

:::info Ensure Correct Peer Dependency
Both `@0xsequence/wagmi-connector` and `@0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin` versions `2.1.0` require `0xsequence` as a peer dependency. Ensure that you are using version `1.1.0` or higher of `0xsequence`. Utilizing older versions may lead to instability in your application.

This is essential to maintain compatibility and ensure the stable operation of your connectors and plugins.
