Sequence provides a metadata service for fetching token metadata for any ERC721 or ERC1155 contract, on [any EVM chain](/multi-chain-support).

* [Learn how to query token metadata directly for any contract](/metadata/token-metadata#fetch-token-metadata-for-any-erc721-or-erc1155-contract)
* [Learn about token metadata standards and formats for ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens](/metadata/token-metadata#token-metadata-standards)

:::info PRO TIP: Sequence Indexer also supports token metadata
When using the [Sequence Indexer](/indexer), pass `"includeMetadata": true` to your request to
query token metadata for any ERC721 or ERC1155 contract. See below how to fetch
token metadata directly.

## Token Metadata Standards

Popular token standards like [EIP721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [EIP1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) both
have similar metadata standard formats with some subtle differences. In addition to the standards, we've seen in practice that projects
often slightly deviate from the standards but are sensical, easy to parse and well supported in the ecosystem, include the Sequence Metadata service.
Below we describe the standards and common practices across projects to help demystify how to format your token metadata for your projects.


## Metadata Standards

### ERC721

ERC721 token contracts contain a method on the contract called `tokenURI(uint256) string`. When querying the `tokenURI` method on the contract, it will return a URI which contains additional metadata for that asset.

See EIP for specific details: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md

Here is an example Bored Ape (token id 9):
https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/mainnet/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/9

response:

```json
{
  "tokenId": "9",
  "contractAddress": "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d",
  "name": "",
  "description": "",
  "image": "https://ipfs.sequence.info/ipfs/QmUQgKka8EW7exiUHnMwZ4UoXA11wV7NFjHAogVAbasSYy",
  "decimals": 0,
  "properties": null,
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Earring",
      "value": "Silver Stud"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Eyes",
      "value": "Sleepy"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Mouth",
      "value": "Small Grin"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Fur",
      "value": "Brown"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Hat",
      "value": "Seaman's Hat"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Clothes",
      "value": "Stunt Jacket"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Background",
      "value": "Purple"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the case of this Bored Ape, it appears there is no name or description set,
but they do have "attributes" as an array of `{ "trait_type": string, "value: string }`.

Additionally, see OpenSea for more information: https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards

Note that OpenSea technically breaks the ERC1155 standard by suggesting to use "attributes", where in fact,
the ERC1155 calls uses the field name "properties" instead of "attributes", see
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#erc-1155-metadata-uri-json-schema (read section below).
However this is completely okay and mixed use of properties / attributes is compatible in practice.
On Sequence Metadata, we support both structures for token contracts which use either format for their [properties/attributes](/metadata/token-metadata#attributes-vs-properties).

Another example is from Neon District: https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x7227e371540CF7b8e512544Ba6871472031F3335/158456331411102687640546264635


### ERC1155

ERC1155 token contracts contain a method on the contract called `uri(uint256) string`. When querying the `uri` method on the
contract, it will return a URI which contains additional metadata for that asset.

See EIP for specific details: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#erc-1155-metadata-uri-json-schema

Here is an example Skyweaver card (token id 65548):
https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x27A11C1563a5dDa238379B95c91B3AbBaD9C0cf6/65548

```json
{
  "tokenId": "65548",
  "contractAddress": "0x27a11c1563a5dda238379b95c91b3abbad9c0cf6",
  "name": "Weighted Die (Silver)",
  "description": "Give +1/+1, armor, and guard to a random ally unit, six times.\n\n\"I will not bow to fate. If the dice fall against me, I'll cut off the hand that cast them.\"\n -Horik",
  "image": "https://assets.skyweaver.net/LV7xNcQh/webapp/cards/full-cards/6x/12-silver.png",
  "decimals": 2,
  "properties": {
    "artists": {
      "name": "Artist",
      "value": [
        {
          "id": "xavi",
          "name": "Henrique Xavier",
          "url": "https://www.artstation.com/kitexavier"
        }
      ]
    },
    "baseCardId": 12,
    "cardType": "Spell",
    "element": "Metal",
    "mana": 8,
    "prism": "Strength",
    "type": "Silver"
  },
  "attributes": null
}
```

As you can see, Skyweaver an ERC1155 token's metadata uses the `properties` object, which is an object/dictionary type of arbitrary data.


### Attributes vs Properties

As you can see, the standard format of token metadata contains both `attributes` and `properties`. The `attributes` field is an array of
objects. The `properties` field is an object/dictionary of arbitrary data. In technical terms, the `attributes` type is defined as 
`[]map<string,any>` and the `properties` type is defined as `map<string,any>`.

In practice, we've seen that many projects use both `attributes` and `properties` to store the same data, and in some cases, they use
`attributes` to store data that should be in `properties` and vice versa. Sometimes project use both fields, and this is completely fine
in practice, as marketplaces and services will parse both areas.

Finally, if you are looking to extend the metadata format to suit your project, we recommend to utilize either or both the `attributes`
and `properties` fields for either ERC721 or ERC1155.


### ERC20

Finally, a note on ERC20 tokens. ERC20 tokens are just a single token, so they themselves do not have a token ID, but
are represented entirely by their contract address. We can infer some information about the token by querying the contract
methods such as `name` and `decimals`. Additionally, ERC20 tokens can take advantage of the `contractURI` extension used
by OpenSea and described in more detail in our [Contract metadata](/metadata/contract-metadata) section.
