# Get your access key in Sequence Builder

Builder is a tool for you to handle all your web3 gaming needs - and it all starts with your **API Access Key** ðŸ”‘

## Generating your API Access Key

Your Key is your starting place, so lets get to it. 

If you haven't already signed up for an account on [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build), do so now â†’ [`sequence.build`](https://sequence.build)

When you create an account, Sequence automatically creates a Sequence wallet associated with your account information.

### Create a Project to get started

Next, you need to create a Project by hitting the **`+ Create new Project`** button.

Give your project a name, add an avatar if you like, and select the networks you want to get started with. (you can always adjust this later).

### Locate your key in Settings

API Access Keys are linked to specific Projects. A key is automatically generated when you create your project - more keys can be created as well.

You can find specific details on your access key by going the `Settings` > `API Access Keys`

From there, select the key you want to use.

### Settings for your keys

There you will be able to copy your key, and set some basic access control on each key.

Each key also has credits associated with it. The amount of credits you receive each month depends on the monthly subscription your project is on.
