# Getting Started

## SDK Installation

We provide a TypeScript SDK for the Auth + WaaS system. You can install it with:

```bash
pnpm install @0xsequence/waas
```

## Project Setup

Sequence WaaS is currently only available as a closed beta. To start using the WaaS SDKs, you'll need to contact the Sequence team and acquire API credentials. Once this is done, you will be provided with two keys:

- Project access key
- WaaS configuration key

## Library Setup

To start using Sequence WaaS SDK, you'll need to create a new instance of the `waas` class:

```typescript
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const waas = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'mumbai'
}, defaults.TEST)
```

Note that the library is operational, but it can't be used to interact with any wallet until you have authenticated **as a user**.
