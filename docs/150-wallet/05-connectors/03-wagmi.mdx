# Using Wagmi

The Sequence wallet used with Wagmi through the connector.

:::tip Try it live :)
Try [a live Dapp example](https://0xsequence.github.io/demo-dapp-wagmi/) using Sequence + Metamask + Wallet Connect with wagmi.

Source code is available too: [https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi)
:::


## Installation

The connector is installed via the npm package `@0xsequence/wagmi-connector`. If you are using the latest version of wagmi (>= 1.0.0) the latest version of the wagmi-connector package can be installed with the following command:

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/wagmi-connector 0xsequence ethers
```
or
```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/wagmi-connector 0xsequence ethers
```

## Usage

The connector is then imported and added to the list of connectors alongside the other wagmi connectors.

```js
import { SequenceConnector } from '@0xsequence/wagmi-connector'

  const connectors = [
    new SequenceConnector({
      chains,
      options: {
        defaultNetwork: 'polygon',
        connect: {
          app: 'Demo-app',
        }
      }
    }),
    ...otherConnectors
  ]
  
  const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
    autoConnect: true,
    connectors,
    publicClient,
    webSocketPublicClient
  })
```

## Parameters

### chains
Chains supported by app. This is the same parameter as would be passed to other RainbowKit wallets.

### options.connect (optional)
Connection details that will be passed to Sequence upon connection, including app name, network id, etc...
A more in depth description of the connect options is available [here](/wallet/guides/connect-wallet#wallet-login-and-connect-options).

### options.defaultNetwork (optional)
The default network to connect to. Sequence will default all operations to this network. It can also be defined using a number (e.g. 1 for Mainnet, 5 for Goerli, etc...).

## Using older versions of Wagmi (\<\= 0.12.x)
If you are using an older version of Wagmi (\<\= 0.12.x), which is based on ethers instead of viem, use the following command to install the appropriate version of the wagmi connector:

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/wagmi-connector@1.0 0xsequence ethers
```
or
```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/wagmi-connector@1.0 0xsequence ethers
```

## Using NextJs
There are special considerations to take into account when using Wagmi with NextJs such that it functions harmoniously with the server-side rendering of NextJs.
The correct technique to use differs depending on whether the application uses the older `pages` router or the more recent `app` router.

See [this section](https://docs.sequence.xyz/wallet/connectors/FAQ/#how-do-i-use-a-wallet-library-and-connector-with-nextjs-using-the-app-directory-version-13-and-above-only) for an explanation on using the Wagmi connector with `app` router.  
See [the example app](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi-next/tree/use-client-method) which uses the `app` router structure.

See [this section](https://docs.sequence.xyz/wallet/connectors/FAQ/#how-do-i-use-a-wallet-library-and-connector-with-nextjs-using-the-pages-directory-all-versions-of-nextjs) for an explanation on using the Wagmi connector with `pages` router.  
See [the example app](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi-next/tree/mount-hook) which uses the `pages` router structure.
