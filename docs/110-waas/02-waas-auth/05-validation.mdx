# Validation

Users with Auth + Embedded Wallet go through two distinct flows based on the login method:

### Email login (one-time code)

For users logging in with an email, Amazon Cognito sends a one-time code to validate their identity. This is a trusted method that does not require additional verification.

### Social login

Users who log in via established social auth providers like Google or Facebook don't need additional validation. However, when logging in using a custom provider, we cannot guarantee sufficient protection of user's identity. Due to this, we might require additional verification by asking the user to provide a one-time code we send to their email address.

Please contact Sequence support if you wish to discuss whether your authentication provider can be considered trusted.

## Validation status

To check the validation status of the current session, use the `isSessionValid` method. This returns `true` for email login and trusted social logins and `false` for custom logins until email validation is complete.

```ts
const isValid = await waas.isSessionValid()
console.log(isValid)
```
```stdout
true
```

### Trigger session validation

Manually trigger a session validation with the `validateSession` method. This will send a code to the user's email. If validated within 10 minutes, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

```ts
const result = await waas.validateSession()
```
```stdout
true
```

Once user receives the code, he can validate the session with the `finishValidateSession` method that takes the code as an argument. If the code is valid, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

```ts
const result = await waas.finishValidateSession('123456')
```
```stdout
true
```

#### onValidationRequired callback

The `onValidationRequired` callback is triggered when a session validation is required. This can happen when a user tries to perform an action that requires validation, such as sending a transaction or signing a message. It determines whether the session validation should be triggered or not. If the callback returns `true`, the session validation is triggered. If it returns `false`, the action is cancelled.

```ts
const tx = await waas.sendERC20({
  validation: {
    onValidationRequired: () => true
  },
  chainId: 42161,
  token: '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f', // DAI
  to: '0x27CabC9700EE6Db2797b6AC1e1eCe81C72A2cD8D',    // Recipient
  value: '200000000000000000000',                      // 200 DAI
})
```

### Listen for session validations

Events like transaction sends may silently prompt session validation. Use the `onValidationRequired` hook to catch such instances.

```ts
waas.onValidationRequired(() => {
  console.log('Session has been triggered for validation');
})

await waas.sendTransaction({ chainId: 1 }, { to: '0x...', value: '1' });
```
```stdout
Session has been triggered for validation
```

## Automatic session validation

Session validation is automatic when certain actions requiring validation are performed. This can be managed using the `onValidationRequired` hook.

```ts
const tx = await waas.sendTransaction({
  chainId: 1,
  validation: {
    onValidationRequired: () => {
      console.log('Session has been triggered for validation');
      return true;
    }
  },
  to: '0x061150e5574716DBb1a2cdf54b3DcE9F94395f65',
  value: '1'
})
```

By returning `true` or `false` from the `onValidationRequired` hook, you either continue or cancel the action, respectively.
