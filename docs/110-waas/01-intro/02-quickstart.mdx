# Quickstart for Embedded Wallet

You can quickly try out a Sequence Embedded Wallet integration before doing a complete configuration specific to your application. There are several ways to test out the features:

- Try out [Sequence WaaS demo](https://waas-demo.sequence.xyz/), showcasing a sample authentication and transaction flow leveraging Sequence Kit for web applications
- Play with [Aviator](https://0xsequence.github.io/waas-airplane-demo/), a complete WebGL game built using Embedded Wallet, leveraging [Sequence Marketplace API](/marketplace) as well as [serverless Cloudflare Worker](/relayer/mint-collectibles-serverless) for minting
- Browse [Jelly Forest source code](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/jelly-forest), our Unity WaaS SDK demo implementation that natively runs on iOS and Android

You can also do a quick integration of Embedded Wallet into your own application by using the following test configuration keys:

- Project Access Key: `AQAAAAAAAEGvyZiWA9FMslYeG_yayXaHnSI`
- WaaS Configuration Key: `eyJwcm9qZWN0SWQiOjE2ODE1LCJycGNTZXJ2ZXIiOiJodHRwczovL3dhYXMuc2VxdWVuY2UuYXBwIn0=`

These will leverage Sequence's own Google and Apple test authentication configurations and are whitelisted for `localhost` usage only. They cannot be used in a production setup.

To see how to integrate these keys into a sample demo application, you can browse the [Demo WaaS repository](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-waas-auth).

You can also view SDK-specific guides here:

- [TypeScript SDK](/waas/intro/)
- [Unity SDK](/unity-waas-sdk)
