# Validation

Users with Auth + WaaS go through two distinct flows based on the login method:

### Social login

Users who log in via established social auth providers like Google or Facebook don't need additional validation. Both Amazon Nitro and the Sequence Guard already validate the provider's `idToken`.

### Email login (magic link)

For users logging in with an email, Amazon Cognito sends a magic link to validate their identity. However, this only covers Amazon's side of things. Sequence Guard performs its own validation. It's advisable to delay this second validation until a wallet-related action is required, to avoid double-validation prompts.

## Validation status

To check the validation status of the current session, use the `isSessionValid` method. This returns `true` for social logins and `false` for email logins until email validation is complete.

```ts
const isValid = await waas.isSessionValid();
console.log(isValid);
```
```stdout
true
```

### Trigger session validation

Manually trigger a session validation with the `validateSession` method. This will send a validation link to the user's email. If validated within 10 minutes, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

```ts
const result = await waas.validateSession();
```
```stdout
true
```

### Listen for session validations

Events like transaction sends may silently prompt session validation. Use the `onValidationRequired` hook to catch such instances.

```ts
waas.onValidationRequired(() => {
  console.log('Session has been triggered for validation');
});

await waas.sendTransaction({ chainId: 1 }, { to: '0x...', value: '1' });
```
```stdout
Session has been triggered for validation
```

## Automatic session validation

Session validation is automatic when certain actions requiring validation are performed. This can be managed using the `onValidationRequired` hook.

```ts
const tx = await waas.sendTransaction({
    chainId: 1,
    onValidationRequired: () => {
      console.log('Session has been triggered for validation');
      return true;
    }
  },
  { to: '0x...', value: '1' }
);
```

By returning `true` or `false` from the `onValidationRequired` hook, you either continue or cancel the action, respectively.
