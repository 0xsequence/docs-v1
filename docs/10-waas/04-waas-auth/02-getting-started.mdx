# Getting Started

## SDK Installation

We provide a TypeScript SDK for the Auth + WaaS system. You can install it with:

```bash
pnpm install @0xsequence/waas
```

## Project Setup

To start interacting with the Auth + WaaS system, you'll need to create a new project on Sequence Builder.

TODO: Explain how to create a project on the builder.

Once you've created a project, you'll obtain API credentials that you can use to authenticate with the Auth + WaaS system.

## Library Setup

To start using the Auth + WaaS SDK, you'll need to create a new instance of the `Waas` class:

```typescript
import SequenceAuth from '@0xsequence/waas'

const waas = new SequenceAuth({
  key: `${process.env.SEQUENCE_API_KEY}`,
})
```

Note that the library is operational, but it can't be used to interact with any wallet until you have authenticated **as a user**.
