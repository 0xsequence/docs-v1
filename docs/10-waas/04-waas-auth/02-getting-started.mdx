# Getting Started

## SDK Installation

We provide a TypeScript SDK for the Auth + WaaS system. You can install it with:

```bash
pnpm install @0xsequence/waas@0.0.0-20231108135717
```

## Project Setup

To start interacting with the Auth + WaaS system, you'll need to create a new project on Sequence Builder.

TODO: Explain how to create a project on the builder.

Once you've created a project, you'll obtain API credentials that you can use to authenticate with the Auth + WaaS system.

## Library Setup

To start using the Auth + WaaS SDK, you'll need to create a new instance of the `Waas` class:

```typescript
import { Sequence } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const waas = new Sequence({
  key: `${process.env.SEQUENCE_API_KEY}`,
})
```

Note that the library is operational, but it can't be used to interact with any wallet until you have authenticated **as a user**.

## Sample credentials

The following configuration can be used as a development preview, **notice that we do not guarantee the availability or security of any wallets created with these credentials**.

```typescript
import { Sequence } from '@0xsequence/waas'

export const sequence = new Sequence({
  network: 'polygon',
  key: 'eyJzZWNyZXQiOiJ0YmQiLCJ0ZW5hbnQiOjksImlkZW50aXR5UG9vbElkIjoidXMtZWFzdC0yOjQyYzlmMzlkLWM5MzUtNGQ1Yy1hODQ1LTVjODgxNWM3OWVlMyJ9',
}, defaults.TEMPLATE_NEXT)
```

Notice that only two oauth providers are available for this configuration: `google` and `email` (only available on `localhost`). For `google` it is possible to use the following credentials:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1041613285238-6hrgdboqrjglsj583njhhseh4b1nh16n.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

::: warning
All the sample credentials are strictly for development purposes and should not be used in production. They are subject to change at any time.
