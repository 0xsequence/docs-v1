# Action payloads

Every Sequence WaaS action that involves a write operation makes use of a payload. Payloads are JSON objects that contain all information about the intent of the action, alongside with the signature of the user that is performing the action.

Payloads are generated on the WaaS SDK and should be sent to the WaaS API in order to complete the action.

:::tip
Calls to the WaaS API are authenticated with the WaaS API key, including calls to the `/sendPayload` endpoint.

The WaaS API key is a secret key that should be kept safe and should never be shared with anyone, nor stored in a client-side application.
:::

## Payload structure

It's important to notice that integrating WaaS **does not** require you to manually manipulate the contents of the payload; yet they are strictly defined, and you can use them if you need to.

The payload structure is as follows:

| Name        | Type        | Description                                       | Optional |
| ---         | ---         | ---                                               | ---      |
| version     | string      | The version of the SDK that generated the payload | No       |
| packet      | object      | Contents, defined by each payload type            | No       |
| signatures  | signature[] | Payload signatures by existing sessions           | Yes      |
| packet.code | string      | Identifier of the payload type.                   | No       |

> The wallet is optional when openning a new session

#### signature type

| Name         | Type   | Description                                           | Optional |

| session      | string | Identifier of the signing session                     | No       |
| signature    | string | Signature of the session for the given payload        | No       |

    "wallet": "0xBc5F07A5852fdF3DBd57A76835109220D0ADd8E8",

  },
  "signatures": [{
    "session": "0xCF67BCbD9D5DFD373b03f4fc8143e1c6744B5696",

  }]
}
```

### Open session payload

This payload is generated when openning a new client-side session on the WaaS SDK. It contains the "proof" that will be used to authenticate the user, and the session data to associate to it.

| Name           | Type   | Description                                        | Optional |
| ---            | ---    | ---                                                | ---      |
| code           | string | The "code" of the payload (`openSession`).         | No       |
| session        | string | The unique identifier for the session              | No       |
| proof          | object | Contains authentication details like JWT and email | No       |
| proof.idToken  | string | OAuth2 id token                                    | Yes      |
| proof.email    | string | User's email address                               | Yes      |

Notice that either `idToken`, `email` or a valid signature *MUST* be present. If `email` is provided, WaaS will send an email on the user's first transaction with this session, asking them to confirm it. 

:::info
The `wallet` parameter is optional *ONLY* for this payload. If passed it will enforce that the opened session matches the requested wallet.

### Close session payload

This payload is generated when the client requests clossing a given session. Notice that the client *MAY* close the current session, or some other session.
