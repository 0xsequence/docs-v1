# Sequence WaaS Modes: An Introduction

Sequence WaaS offers two modes to fit your app's needs: Standalone WaaS and Sequence Auth + WaaS. Standalone WaaS works with your existing backend to add wallet features. Sequence Auth + WaaS is a full package that manages both user authentication and wallets.

## Standalone WaaS

Standalone WaaS integrates with your current backend. It lets you add wallet capabilities without changing how you handle users. You'll deploy a "PSS - Partner Signer Server" to hold a private key and expose an RPC API for wallet management.

**Note**: Make sure your existing account system securely authenticates users. The PSS trusts that each request is properly authorized by your backend.

### Standalone WaaS Components

- **PSS**: Holds your app's private key and manages wallets through an RPC API. Comes as a Docker image.
- **WaaS SDK**: A typescript library for wallet creation and management.

## Sequence Auth + WaaS

This mode is an all-in-one solution for user authentication and wallets. It's standalone and can't be used with other account systems without causing a double login issue.

### Sequence Auth + WaaS Components

- **Auth WaaS SDK**: A typescript library for accounts, sessions, and wallets. No separate backend needed.
