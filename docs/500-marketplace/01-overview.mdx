# Sequence Market

Sequence Market is a p2p marketplace powered by the Sequence Orderbook and Niftyswap protocol, a Semi-Fungible Token (SFT) AMM protocol for fully automated collectible marketplace that runs on every EVM network.

While Uniswap is for trading coins (ERC-20 tokens), Niftyswap is a protocol dedicated to trading SFTs (ERC-1155 tokens). Both are designed to favor ease of use and provide access to liquidity on-chain.
