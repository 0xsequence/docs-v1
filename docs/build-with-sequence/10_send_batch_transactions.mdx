# Sending a Batch of Transactions

Likewise, bundling multiple transactions to be send in a single native transaction is equally as easy:

```ts
const transaction1 = {
  to: recipient1Address,
  value: 1000000000000000000
}

const transaction2 = {
  to: recipient2Address,
  value: 1000000000000000000
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransactionBatch([transaction1, transaction2])
console.log(response)
```
