# Signing & Verifying Transactions

You can ask the wallet to sign either a single transaction or multiple ones:

```ts
const transaction = {
  to: recipientAddress,
  value: '1000000000000000000'
}

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
const signature = await signer.signTransactions([transaction])
console.log(signature)
```

If you want to override the default network, you can also customize that as well:

```ts
const signature = await signer.signTransactions([transaction], 137 /* Polygon */)
console.log(signature)
```
