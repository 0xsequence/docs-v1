# Sending a Transaction

Signing a transaction will only retrieve the signed payload.
If you want the wallet to actually dispatch the transaction to the network as well, that requires only a small modification to the previous example (note the change from `signTransactions` to `sendTransaction`):

```
const transaction = {
  to: daiContractAddress,
  value: 1000000000000000000,
  data: '0x',
  gasLimit: 0,
  delegateCall: false,
  revertOnError: false
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransaction(transaction)
console.log(response)
```
