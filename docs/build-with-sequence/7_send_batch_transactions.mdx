# Sending a Batch of Transactions

Likewise, bundling multiple transactions to be send in a single native transaction is equally as easy:

```
const transaction1 = {
  to: toAddress1,
  value: 1000000000000000000,
  data: '0x',
  gasLimit: 0,
  delegateCall: false,
  revertOnError: false
}

const transaction2 = {
  to: toAddress2,
  value: 1000000000000000000,
  data: '0x',
  gasLimit: 0,
  delegateCall: false,
  revertOnError: false
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransactionBatch([transaction1, transaction2])
console.log(response)
```
