# Installation

The sequence.js SDK is composed of several sub-packages combined into a single meta-package called 0xsequence.
To add the SDK to your project, add a dependency on 0xsequence to your package.json, by running either `npm add 0xsequence` or `yarn add 0xsequence`.
If you know that your project only requires specific sub-packages, you can also depend on those directly with `npm add @0xsequence/<sub-package name>`.

Your package.json should look like this:
```json
{
  "name": "demo-dapp",
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "0xsequence": "^0.35.0",
    ...
  }
}
```
