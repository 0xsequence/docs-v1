# Get Wallet Account Address

## Ask for the account address

To get the user's Sequence wallet address:

```ts
const address = await wallet.getAddress()
console.log(address)
```

## Authenticate the account address

In many cases, you'll want your users to connect and then verify their account address. Many dapps do this by asking the user
to sign a message, and then verify the signature from the user to ensure it's integrity.

As this is such a common workflow, Sequence can automatically authenticate the account address at the same time
while the user is prompt to connect their wallet to your dapp. This allows the user experience to be simpler and
more seamless, with less confusion and clicks -- it's a subtle thing, but makes a big difference.

```ts
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'

const wallet = new sequence.Wallet()

const connectDetails = await wallet.connect({
  app: 'Your Dapp name',
  authorize: true // <---<<< this will automatically sign+verify a EIP712 message when user clicks "Connect"
})
```

In the above example, we pass `authorize: true` to the `connect()` function, which will automatically have the user
sign a EIP712 signed message to prove their identity. This allows you to then easily authenticate the connected
wallet address with absolutely certainty.

FYI, you can find the signed message proof returned in `connectDetails.proof`, which is an EIP712 signed object using
a simple a convention from [ethauth](https://github.com/0xsequence/ethauth.js). NOTE: EIP712 is just like a normal
signed message, but if allows you to use an actual object for signing instead of just a plain-text string.


## Authenticate the account address server-side

The above example demonstrates how to connect and verify the user's identity in your dapp on the client-side,
but if you'd like to authenticate the Sequence authorization proof on your server, then you can do so with the following snippet:

```ts
const ethAuth = new ETHAuth()

try {
  const decodedProof = await ethAuth.decodeProof(connectDetails.proof.proofString)
  console.log('welcome user address', decodedProof.address)

} catch (err) {
  console.log('proof is invalid -- do not trust the provided account address')
}
```

See the [Go Sequence SDK](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence) on using Sequence in your Go applications.

If your server is written in a language other then Javascript/Typescript or Go, all you have to do is validate
the signature with [EIP1271, the standard method for validating signed messages for a smart wallet](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271).
