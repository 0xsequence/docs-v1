# Installation

The sequence.js SDK is composed of several sub-packages combined into a single meta-package called `0xsequence`.
To add the SDK to your project, add a dependency on 0xsequence to your package.json:

```sh
yarn add 0xsequence
```

or

```sh
npm install --save 0xsequence
```

If you know that your project only requires specific sub-packages, you can also depend on those directly with
`npm add @0xsequence/<sub-package name>`.

Your package.json should look something like this (actual version may vary):
```json
{
  "name": "my-dapp",
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "0xsequence": "^0.40.5",
    ...
  }
}
```

### CDN distribution as native JS

Optionally, `0xsequence` can be installed as a JS script source (UMD distribution) via:

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/0xsequence@latest/dist/0xsequence.umd.min.js"></script>
```
