# Signing & Verifying Transactions

You can ask the wallet to sign either a single transaction or multiple ones:

```ts
const transaction = {
  to: toAddress,
  data: '0x',
  value: '1000000000000000000',
  gasLimit: 0,
  delegateCall: false,
  revertOnError: false
}

const signer = await wallet.getSigner()
const signature = await signer.signTransactions([transaction])
console.log(signature)
```

If you want to override the default network, you can also customize that as well:

```ts
const transaction = {
  to: toAddress,
  data: '0x',
  value: '1000000000000000000',
  gasLimit: 0,
  delegateCall: false,
  revertOnError: false
}

const signer = await wallet.getSigner()
const signature = await signer.signTransactions([transaction], 137 /* Polygon */)
console.log(signature)
```
