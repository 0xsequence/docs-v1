# Signing & Verifying Messages

## Signing Messages

Sequence wallets are able to sign arbitrary messages because they conform to a standard defined by EIP-1271.

To request a user's signature:

```ts
const signer = wallet.getSigner()
const message = 'Hello World!'

const signature = await signer.signMessage(message)
console.log(signature)
```

## Verifying Messages

Given a message and signature, you can check if a particular wallet signed that message:

```ts
const address = await wallet.getAddress()
const chainId = await wallet.getChainId()

const isValid = await wallet.commands.isValidMessageSignature(address, message, signature, chainId)
console.log(isValid)
```
