# Sending an ERC-721 (NFT) Token

Sending an ERC-721 NFT is similar to sending an ERC-20 token.
The only notable difference is in the contract standard itself:

```ts
const erc721Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface([
  'function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)'
])

// Encode the transfer of the NFT tokenId to recipient
const address = await wallet.getAddress()
const data = erc721Interface.encodeFunctionData('safeTransferFrom', [address, recipientAddress, tokenId])

const transaction = {
  to: erc721TokenAddress,
  data
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransaction(transaction)
console.log(response)
```

With batching functionality, you can send multiple token transfers in a single native transaction:

```ts
const erc721Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface([
  'function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)'
])

// Encode two different ERC-721 token transfers
const data1 = erc721Interface.encodeFunctionData('safeTransferFrom', [address, recipient1Address, amount1])
const data2 = erc721Interface.encodeFunctionData('safeTransferFrom', [address, recipient2Address, amount2])

const transaction1 = {
  to: erc721ContractAddress,
  data: data1
}

const transaction2 = {
  to: erc721ContractAddress,
  data: data2
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransactionBatch([transaction1, transaction2])
console.log(response)
```
