git@github.com:0xsequence/docs.git# Connect Wallet

Sequence is a very flexible wallet which allow users multiple ways to connect / access their wallet. This includes:

1. **On-demand Ethereum web wallet for new users** via [0xsequence](https://www.npmjs.com/package/0xsequence) npm package + https://sequence.app -- this option allows
   developers to offer users an on-demand Web3 wallet. No user install required -- any browser will _just work_, and users
   can on-board with a familiar Web2 experience. Think of it like _Paypal / Stripe but for Web3_.

2. **Surf all of Web3** via [Sequence Wallet Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sequence-wallet/ocmccklecaalljlflmclidjeclpcpdim?hl=en) -- users
   who have the Sequence Wallet Chrome Extension installed are able to access any Ethereum-compatible Dapp on the Web :) Just like how MetaMask works,
   but of course with a bunch of the benefits of Sequence.

3. **Mobile phone access** via [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) support within Sequence Wallet -- users are able to communicate with their wallets remotely
   via the awesome Wallet Connect protocol. This is an excellent option if using Sequence Wallet from your mobile phone and want to connect
   your wallet to a desktop dapp.

Sequence Wallet is built on Web Browser (W3C) and Ethereum Web3 standards -- and is available everywhere that a modern browser is able to run.
We've carefully designed the wallet for simple on-boarding, while maintaining security for users, and allowing users to progressively
increase the level of their security through additional keys and measures.

This means, that if you've developed a dapp to work with MetaMask, then Sequence will work too without any changes. If you're
using web3.js or ethers.js, Sequence will just work too. This is the beauty of interoperability on web3 :D

## Connecting your dapp with `0xsequence`

:::info A delightful wallet without requiring your users to install anything :)
By integrating `0xsequence`, users may access your dapp without having to install any special extensions,
and the wallet also works on mobile browsers!
:::

Your dapp can connect to your user's wallet by first instantiating the Wallet provider:

```ts
import { sequence } from "0xsequence";

// This assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet
const wallet = new sequence.Wallet();

// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name as the argument
// const wallet = new sequence.Wallet('polygon')
```

Once you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:

```ts
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect({
  app: 'Your Dapp name',
  authorize: true
  // And pass settings if you would like to customize further
  settings: {
    theme: "light",
    bannerUrl: "https://yoursite.com/banner-image.png",  // 3:1 aspect ratio, 1200x400 works best
    includedPaymentProviders: ["moonpay", "ramp"],
    defaultFundingCurrency: "matic",
    lockFundingCurrencyToDefault: false,
  }
})

console.log('user accepted connect?', connectDetails.connected)
console.log('users signed connect proof to valid their account address:', connectDetails.proof)
```

After you connect, you can use `wallet.openWallet()` to open the wallet:

```ts
wallet.openWallet();
```

You can also optionally pass a path, and use `openWithOptions` intent to pass settings when you open the wallet:

```ts
const settings: Settings = {
  theme: "goldDark",
  bannerUrl: "https://yoursite.com/banner-image.png", // 3:1 aspect ratio, 1200x400 works best
  includedPaymentProviders: ["moonpay", "ramp"],
  defaultFundingCurrency: "eth",
  lockFundingCurrencyToDefault: false,
};
const intent: OpenWalletIntent = {
  type: "openWithOptions",
  options: {
    settings: settings,
  },
};
const path = "wallet/add-funds";
wallet.openWallet(path, intent);
```

:::tip Check out some example Dapp source code
For a complete examples, see [Demo-Dapp](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp) and [Demo-Dapp-Web3Modal](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-web3modal).

:::caution Avoid Browsers Blocking Sequence Popup
Most browsers will block popups if they are called outside of user-triggered event handlers like `onclick`, or when it takes too long to process between the user action and the actual window

## Connecting your dapp with `web3.js` or `ethers.js`

For a full example of a dapp which supports Sequence (on-demand + chrome extension), Metamask, and WalletConnect
please see the [Demo-Dapp-Web3Modal repo](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-web3modal).

## Connecting to any Ethereum dapp with the Sequence Wallet Chrome Extension

## Connecting via `WalletConnect`

Sequence already supports connecting to dapps via [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com).
If your dapp already supports WalletConnect, and you don't need Sequence-specific functionality, nothing more needs to be done.
From the user's perspective, the WalletConnect flow behaves as follows.

Taking [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org) as an example, the user is prompted to connect their wallet using one of multiple possible protocols.

<img src="/img/walletconnect/connect-wallet.png" />

The user selects the WalletConnect option.

<img src="/img/walletconnect/select-walletconnect.png" />

A QR code is displayed, which can be scanned by Sequence.
Alternatively, the user can also choose to copy the connection details via their OS clipboard.

<img src="/img/walletconnect/qr-code.png" />

Back in the Sequence interface, the user chooses "Scan".

<img src="/img/walletconnect/scan.png" />

The QR code from the dapp is scanned.
Alternatively, the code is pasted from the OS clipboard if the user chose that previously.

<img src="/img/walletconnect/scan-qr-code.png" />

The user confirms the connection request.

<img src="/img/walletconnect/confirm.png" />

The connection succeeded, and the dapp is updated to reflect that.

<img src="/img/walletconnect/success.png" />

While connected, the dapp is able to make signing requests to Sequence.
Sequence will always prompt for confirmation from the user for any activity initiated by the dapp.

Once the user has finished using the dapp, they can disconnect the wallet via the session menu.
