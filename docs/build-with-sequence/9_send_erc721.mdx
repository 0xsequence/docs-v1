# Sending an ERC-721 (NFT) Token

Sending an ERC-721 NFT is similar to sending an ERC-20 token.
The only notable difference is in the contract standard itself:

```ts
const erc721Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface(['function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)'])

// Encode the transfer of the NFT tokenId to recipient
const address = await wallet.getAddress()
const data = erc721Interface.encodeFunctionData('safeTransferFrom', [address, recipientAddress, tokenId])

const transaction = {
  to: erc721TokenAddress,
  data
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransaction(transaction)
console.log(response)
```
