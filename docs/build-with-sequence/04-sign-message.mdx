# Signing & Verifying Messages

## Signing Messages

Sequence wallets are able to sign arbitrary messages because they conform to a standard defined by EIP-1271.

To request a user's signature:

```ts
const signer = wallet.getSigner()
const message = 'Hello World!'

const signature = await signer.signMessage(message)
console.log(signature)
```

## Verifying Message Signatures

:::info Sequence is a Smart Contract based account
As a Smart Contract-based account, Sequence signatures must be validated with the standard
EIP1271 method, see https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271
:::

Given a message and signature, you can check if a particular wallet signed that message:

```ts
const provider = wallet.getProvider()

const walletAddress = await wallet.getAddress()
const chainId = await wallet.getChainId()

// The sequence utils `isValidMessageSignature` method supports validating both 
// EOA and Smart Wallet (EIP1271) signatures with this simple call.
const isValid = await sequence.utils.isValidMessageSignature(
  walletAddress,
  message,
  signature,
  provider,
  chainId
)

console.log(isValid)
```

### Notes on Signature Validation with EIP1271

Smart Contract-based wallets like Sequence rely on the [EIP1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) standard for signature validation.

The EIP1271 is a single function on a contract defined as:

```solidity
function isValidSignature(
  bytes32 _hash, 
  bytes memory _signature
) public view returns (bytes4 magicValue)
```

The first `_hash` argument accepts the hash of the message digest, and the second argument `_signature`
is the signed payload returned by the wallet upon signing. 

For Javascript/Typescript signature verification, you can use `0xsequence` utility functions like so:

```ts
import { 0xsequence } from '0xsequence'

const isValid = await sequence.utils.isValidSignature(
  walletAddress,
  digest,
  signature,
  provider,
  chainId
)

console.log(isValid) // returns true/false
```

Alternatively you can also use `sequence.utils.isValidMessageSignature` or `sequence.utils.isValidTypedDataSignature`
which are just syntactic sugar for `sequence.utils.isValidSignature`.

All of the methods above are designed to work in a Web Browser or nodejs. As well, for convenience
the signature validation fucntions above support verifying EOA or Smart Wallet signatures. This allows you
to use a single code path in your Dapp to verify any kind of signature and support multiple wallets at the same
time, like Metamask, Sequence, WalletConnect, Argent, Rainbow, etc. -- all Ethereum compatible wallets, EOA
or Smart Wallets, will *just work*.
