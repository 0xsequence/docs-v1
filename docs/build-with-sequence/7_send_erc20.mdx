# Sending an ERC-20 Token

You can ask the wallet to send a single ERC-20 token transfer:

```ts
const erc20Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface([
  'function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)'
])

// Encode an ERC-20 token transfer to recipient of the specified amount
const data = erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'transfer', [recipientAddress, amount]
)

const transaction = {
  to: daiContractAddress,
  data
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransaction(transaction)
console.log(response)
```

With batching functionality, you can send multiple token transfers in a single native transaction:

```ts
const erc20Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface([
  'function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)'
])

// Encode two different ERC-20 token transfers
const data1 = erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'transfer', [recipient1Address, amount1]
)
const data2 = erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData(
  'transfer', [recipient2Address, amount2]
)

const transaction1 = {
  to: daiContractAddress,
  data: data1
}

const transaction2 = {
  to: daiContractAddress,
  data: data2
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransactionBatch([transaction1, transaction2])
console.log(response)
```
