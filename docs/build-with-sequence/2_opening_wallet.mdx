# Opening Wallet

Your dapp can connect to your user's wallet by first instantiating the Wallet provider:

```
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'

// This assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet
const wallet = new sequence.Wallet()

// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name as the argument
// const wallet = new sequence.Wallet('polygon')
```

Once you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:

```
await wallet.connect({
  app: 'Demo Dapp',
  authorize: true
})
```
