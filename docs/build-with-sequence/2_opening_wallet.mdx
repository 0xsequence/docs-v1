# Opening Wallet

Your dapp can connect to your user's wallet by first instantiating the Wallet provider:

```ts
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'

// This assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet
const wallet = new sequence.Wallet()

// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name as the argument
// const wallet = new sequence.Wallet('polygon')
```

Once you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:

```ts
await wallet.connect({
  app: 'Demo Dapp',
  authorize: true
})
```

## Connecting Other Dapps to the Sequence Wallet using WalletConnect

Sequence wallet already supports connecting to dapps via [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com).
If your dapp already supports WalletConnect, and you don't need Sequence-specific functionality, nothing more needs to be done.
From the user's perspective, the WalletConnect flow behaves as follows.

Taking [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org) as an example, the user is prompted to connect their wallet using one of multiple possible protocols.

The user selects the WalletConnect option.

A QR code is displayed, which can be scanned by Sequence.
Alternatively, the user can also choose to copy the connection details via their OS clipboard.

Back in the Sequence interface, the user chooses "Scan".

The QR code from the dapp is scanned.
Alternatively, the code is pasted from the OS clipboard if the user chose that previously.

The user confirms the connection request.

The connection succeeded, and the dapp is updated to reflect that.

While connected, the dapp is able to make signing requests to Sequence.
Sequence will always prompt for confirmation from the user for any activity initiated by the dapp.

Once the user has finished using the dapp, they can disconnect the wallet via the session menu.
