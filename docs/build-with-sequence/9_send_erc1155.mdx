# Sending an ERC-1155 (Collectible) Token

Sending an ERC-1155 collectible is similar to sending an ERC-20 token.
The only notable difference is in the contract standard itself:

```ts
const erc1155Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface(['function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data)'])

// Encode the transfer of the collectible to recipient
const address = await wallet.getAddress()
const data = erc1155Interface.encodeFunctionData('safeTransferFrom', [address, recipientAddress, tokenId, 1, '0x'])

const transaction = {
  to: erc1155TokenAddress,
  data
}

const response = await wallet.sendTransaction(transaction)
console.log(response)
```
