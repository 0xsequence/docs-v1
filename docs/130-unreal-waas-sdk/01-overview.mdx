# Introduction

The Sequence Unreal Embedded Wallet SDK provides full Sequence [Embedded Wallet](/waas/intro/) and [Indexer](/indexer) integration for games built on the Unreal Framework.

This SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`major.minor.patch`). While we're still in `0.x.y` builds, API breaking changes can be made at any time. After `1.0.0`, breaking changes will always cause a `major` version increment, non-breaking new features will cause a `minor` version increment, and bugfixes will cause a `patch` version increment.

Sequence Unreal SDK is only available as a private beta at the moment. To get access, get in touch with [Sequence BD Team](https://sequence.xyz/contact).
