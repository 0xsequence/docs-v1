# Setup

1) Once you have the the `SequencePlugin` folder, you'll need to go to your project directory and create a `Plugins` folder in it, then copy over the `SequencePlugin` folder into the `Plugins` folder. If a `Plugins` folder already exists just copy the `SequencePlugin` folder into it.

2) Launch your project, then allow it to update the UProject Settings.

3) To find the `SequencePlugin` content folder in your content drawer enable view plugin content

4) If you wish to use the in built sequence UI for login
    a) Create an `[Actor]` you wish to be responsible for the SequenceUI then attach the `[Sequence_Pawn_Component_BP]` to it
    b) Setup your `[Actor]` Blueprint similar to how it's setup in `[Custom_Spectator_Pawn]` being sure to bind to the delegate that gives you Credentials `[Auth_Success_Forwarder]`

5) Once you have those credentials you'll need to forward them to your own C++ backend in order to use the Sequence API, an example of this can be found in the `[Custom_Spectator_Pawn]`. This Pawn inherits from a C++ class `[Sqnc_Spec_Pawn]`, which implements a blueprint Callable function `[SetupCredentials(FCredentials_BE CredentialsIn)]`. This is callable within the child class `[Custom_Spectator_Pawn]`. Calling this function will forward the credentials to a C++ backend.
