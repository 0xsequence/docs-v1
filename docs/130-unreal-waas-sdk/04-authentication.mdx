## Authentication

### Custom UI Integration

In a C++ backend with a series of pass through `[UFUNCTIONS]` setup similarly to `[SequenceBackendManager.h/.cpp]`. Each of these calls are implemented in `[UAuthenticator]` you just need to pass through the data with YOUR UAuthenticator UObject

```clike
//This call is platform dependent on windows & mac this is required for SSO WIP
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, CATEGORY = "Login")
FString GetLoginURL(const ESocialSigninType& Type); 

//This Call is made after you've collected the ID_Token (Mac & Windows only) WIP
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, CATEGORY = "Login")
void SocialLogin(const FString& IDTokenIn);

//This Call is made after you've collected the email address from the Users in the UI
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, CATEGORY = "Login")
void EmailLogin(const FString& EmailIn);

//This is call is made after the Delegate `[AuthRequiresCode]` is fired
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, CATEGORY = "Login")
void EmailCode(const FString& CodeIn);

//Optional call used to check if the credentials on disk are valid or not//
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "Login")
bool StoredCredentialsValid();
```


To start you'll want to create a `[UAuthenticator]` UObject like so `[UAuthenticator + Auth = NewObject<UAuthenticator>()]`, this UObject manages the authentication side of Sequence.

Be sure to bind to the Delegates for `[AuthSuccess]`, `[AuthFailure]`, `[AuthRequiresCode]` prior to making any signin calls You can bind to these delegates like so:

```clike
this->authenticator->AuthRequiresCode.AddDynamic(this, &AYourClass::YourCallReadyToReceiveCode);
this->authenticator->AuthFailure.AddDynamic(this, &AYourClass::YourCallShowAuthFailureScreen);
```

In the case of `[AuthSuccess]` since a parameter is also passed we bind to it like this

```clike
FScriptDelegate del;
del.BindUFunction(this, "CallShowAuthSuccessScreen");
this->authenticator->AuthSuccess.Add(del);
```

Where `[CallShowAuthSuccessScreen]` is defined in `SequenceBackendManager.h` like so:

```clike
UFUNCTION()
void CallShowAuthSuccessScreen(const FCredentials_BE& CredentialsIn);
```

And in `SequenceBackendManager.cpp` like so:

```clike
void ASequenceBackendManager::CallShowAuthSuccessScreen(const FCredentials_BE& CredentialsIn) 
{
this->Credentials = CredentialsIn;
if (this->ShowAuthSuccessDelegate.IsBound())
  this->ShowAuthSuccessDelegate.Broadcast(Credentials);
else
  UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("`[Nothing bound to: ShowAuthSuccessDelegate]`"));
}
```

### Email based Authentication

1) To start email based authentication you'll start it with this call `[EmailLogin(const FString& EmailIn)]`, supplying an email you've collected from the User in your GUI.

2) Next `[AuthRequiresCode]` will fire when the backend is ready to receive the Code from your UI. Collect this code from your GUI and send it to the authenticator using `[EmailCode(CodeIn)]`.

3) Finally `[AuthSuccess]` will fire with a Credentials_BE struct as a parameter. This is your non registered credentials from EmailAuth. You are done Email Based Auth.

### Social Signin based Authentication on Desktop

1) To start SSO based authentication with desktop you can either use your own implementation to get the necessary id_token or you can make use of Unreal's web browser plugin.

2) With whatever implementation you chose you can forward the colleted id_token to the UAuthenticator object with `[SocialLogin(const FString& IDTokenIn)]`, after which `[AuthSuccess]` will fire and you're done desktop based SSO.
