# Key Management

Each Sequence wallet can be controlled by multiple private keys, acting like a multisignature wallet. Users can either create a Sequence wallet using one of the supported social login options or create a wallet with a private key stored only on that device.

The improved security compared to traditional blockchain wallet comes from the fact that multiple independent keys need to be compromised for a malicious actor to take control of a userâ€™s wallet, instead of a single key. The philosophy is that the more independent private-keys the user adds to their wallet, the more secure their wallet becomes, even if each individual key is only moderately secure on their own.
