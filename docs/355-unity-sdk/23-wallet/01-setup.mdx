# Setup

To start, you'll need to include the Sequence Wallet Prefab `SequenceSDK/SequenceSharp/Prefabs/SequenceWalletPrefab.prefab`.

Put the prefab in your scene, inside a Canvas.

Position and scale it; this will be the viewport where the wallet is rendered in non-WebGL builds.

You can edit the properties in the inspector to hook up events, as well as set the default network and enable some debugging tools.

Before calling any Wallet methods, you should hook up the `onWalletOpened`, `onWalletClosed`, `onAuthWindowOpened`, and `onAuthWindowClosed` events.
Sequence will automatically make itself visible and invisible, but you might have extra chrome / animations you'd like to add to the wallet and/or auth window (close wallet buttons, etc).

A simple solution is adding a Canvas Group and moving the `SequenceWalletPrefab` prefab inside it, and toggling visibility when the wallet opens/closes.
These callbacks might not occur on the main thread in some builds (e.g. Android), so make sure you use a UnityMainThread job to do your visbility toggling on the main thread.

```csharp
  wallet.onWalletOpened.AddListener(() => {
    UnityMainThread.wkr.AddJob(() => {
      walletContainer.alpha = 1f;
      walletContainer.interactable = true;
      walletContainer.blocksRaycasts = true;
    });
  });
  wallet.onWalletClosed.AddListener(() => {
    UnityMainThread.wkr.AddJob(() => {
      walletContainer.alpha = 1f;
      walletContainer.interactable = true;
      walletContainer.blocksRaycasts = true;
    });
  });
```

All the Sequence Wallet functions & classes are namespaced in the `SequenceSharp` namespace, so you might want to add `using SequenceSharp;` at the top of your CS files.

Before interacting with the SDK, you should make sure it's ready:
```csharp
        if (wallet.readyToConnect) {
          // your Connect function call here
        } else {
          wallet.onReadyToConnect.AddListener(()=> {
          // your Connect function call here
          });
        }
```

Once it's ready, you can move on to connecting to the wallet!
