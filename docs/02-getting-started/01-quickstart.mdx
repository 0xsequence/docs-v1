const wallet = sequence.initWallet('polygon')
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect()

console.log('=> connected?', connectDetails.connected)
```

## Get the wallet address

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()
const walletAddress = await wallet.getAddress()

console.log(walletAddress)

```

## Open the wallet from your dapp

```ts

wallet.openWallet()
```

## Get the blockchain network ID

You can use a variety of methods to query the chain ID which the wallet is presently
connected to.

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()

console.log('chainId:', await wallet.getChainId())

const provider = wallet.getProvider()
console.log('provider.getChainId()', await provider.getChainId())

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
console.log('signer.getChainId()', await signer.getChainId())
```
