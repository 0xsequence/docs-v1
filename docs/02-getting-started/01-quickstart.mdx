## Get the blockchain network ID

You can use a variety of methods to query the chain ID which the wallet is presently
connected to.

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()

console.log('chainId:', await wallet.getChainId())

const provider = wallet.getProvider()
console.log('provider.getChainId()', await provider.getChainId())

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
console.log('signer.getChainId()', await signer.getChainId())
```
