# Quick Start

Get started with Sequence with just a few lines of code, follow along below.
 
## Install

First, install the [0xsequence](https://www.npmjs.com/package/0xsequence) and [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers) packages from NPM:

```sh
npm install 0xsequence ethers
```
or

```sh
pnpm install 0xsequence ethers
```
or

```sh
yarn add 0xsequence ethers
```

You can find the source of the `0xsequence` package on [Github](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js).


## Connect your wallet

**Connecting to Ethereum Mainnet:**

```ts
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'

const wallet = sequence.initWallet({ defaultNetwork: 'mainnet' })
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect(({ app: 'Your app name' }))

console.log('=> connected?', connectDetails.connected)
```

**Connecting to Polygon:**
```ts
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'

const wallet = sequence.initWallet({ defaultNetwork: 'polygon' })
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect(({ app: 'Your app name' }))

console.log('=> connected?', connectDetails.connected)
```

:::info Required fields
`defaultNetwork` is optional, the wallet can always be used to interact with any supported network by using the `getProvider('<network>')` and `getSigner(<network>)` methods.

`app` during connect is **always** required, this is the name of your dapp, and will be shown to the user when they are asked to connect their wallet.
:::

## Get the wallet address

Once connected to the wallet, you can get the wallet address:

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()
const walletAddress = wallet.getAddress()

console.log(walletAddress)
// # => '0xabcd....'
```

Trying to get the wallet address before the wallet is connected will throw an error.

## Open the wallet from your dapp

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()
wallet.openWallet()
```

## Get the blockchain network ID

You can use a variety of methods to query the chain ID which the wallet is presently
connected to.

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()

console.log('chainId:', await wallet.getChainId())

const provider = wallet.getProvider()
console.log('provider.getChainId()', await provider.getChainId())

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
console.log('signer.getChainId()', await signer.getChainId())
```
