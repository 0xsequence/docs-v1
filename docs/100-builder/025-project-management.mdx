# Project Management
Creation of projects is seamless in just several clicks. This process requires no KYC, only that users comply with Global [regulations and policies](https://support.sequence.xyz/en/articles/6220364-sequence-list-of-restricted-regions), and an agreement to the platforms' terms of service.

##### Project Name
Choose a `project name` - something playful, serious, or just something unique to distinguish your new project amongst the other projects linked to your wallet.

##### Avatar
Upload a custom `avatar` to your project that displays aspects of your identity you want to be included as part of your project, or, something specific to the theme of what you're building. Learned about later, you can always update your collaborators and coordinate across the internet so Avatars can be a stepping stone to trust.

##### Configure networks
Configure 1 or multiple `networks` for a single project from the 11 offered production / mainnet networks, or, 8 test networks, with a simple flip of a toggle. At any point, the networks for your project chosen can be updated in the settings.

All 3 of these values: `Project name`, your `avatar`, and your configured `networks` can be changed later.
