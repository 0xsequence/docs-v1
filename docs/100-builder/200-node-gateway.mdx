# Node Gateway in Builder

Sequence Builder offers a comprehensive Node Gateway dashboard that provides you with all the information needed to manage your node infrastructure, from compatibility with your favorite Web3 module to your requirement for real-time performant data for your game.

##### What kind of performance can I expect for my game?
Sequence Node Gateway is engineered to power your gaming infrastructure. Node Gateway aggregates multiple node providers, auto-switching between them to ensure correct and in sync data availability — giving you the assurance that your decentralized applications run smoothly with low latency for your players.

No need to worry about peak traffic – our node infrastructure is robust, offering higher scalability and fault tolerance. Additionally, we provide automatic node failure detection and recovery.

##### What can you do to simplify the integration process for me?
We've designed our dashboard to automatically generate API access keys and URLs for each network you have enabled in settings. This makes it easy to import the URL into your preferred Web3 npm module. Additionally, our dashboard makes it easy to monitor your compute usage and credit consumption.
