# How to refill the Gas Tank in Builder

In this walkthrough, we will show you how to refill your gas tank in Builder with a credit card. Gas is used to [sponsor gas for contracts](https://docs.sequence.xyz/builder/sponsor-contract-gas-tank) and manage your relayers, so it's important to know how to keep your tank full.

### Prerequisite: Sign up and Create a Project

This guide assumes that you have already [signed up for Builder and created a Project](https://docs.sequence.xyz/builder/signup-and-create-a-project). It's also worth noting that you need a smart contract to use gas on a sponsor. Deploying contracts on Builder is easy, and you [can learn how to do so here](https://docs.sequence.xyz/builder/deploy-an-item-collection-contract).


### Step 1. Go to the Gas Tank

Start by going to your Gas Tank. Each project has its own Gas Tank, so if you have not selected a specific project to manage your gas tank on, do so first.

Select a project by clicking on it.

Then click on the Gas Tank section.

### Step 2. Refill your Gas 

Inside your Gas Tank dashboard, you will see how much funding you have in gas remaining and how much gas was recently used. 

Below this, you will see all of your sponsored contracts that are using your gas.

To add more gas, click on the `+` button next to your current balance at the top.

This will pop up a modal requesting the amount you want to refill.

Enter an amount of gas to refill and click `Continue with Credit Card`

Next, it will bring you to a credit card checkout screen.

Fill in your credit card details and click the `Pay` button to continue.

Upon success, this will bring you back to the Gas Tank dashboard.

Look for the green success notification at the bottom to confirm your payment.
