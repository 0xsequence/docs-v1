# Indexer in Builder

Sequence Builder equips game builders with an indexer that collects data from the following networks: Ethereum (and Sepolia), Optimism, Base, Gnosis Chain, Polygon (and Polygon Mumbai), Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, Gnosis Chain, BNB Smart Chain (and Smart Chain Testnet), Avalanche (and Avalanche Testnet), Oasys Homeverse (and Oasys Homeverse Testnet).

#### What data can I query for my game?
Builder takes the stress out of gathering on-chain data for your game. Simply select the data you want from the indexer, and it generates the necessary code in snippets.

Fetch different kinds of data from the indexer:
- tokens and collectibles owned by any wallet
- total supply for any token or collectible
- the transaction and transfer history for any wallet address
- contract metadata for any token or collection
- metadata for any collectible
- balance change events for any token or collection

#### How much code will I have to write to query?
Sequence Indexer offers several features that level-up your on-chain data capabilities without writing a line of code. It boasts a user-friendly interface that you can use to fetch important data, like the tokens owned by a specific wallet under a specific contract, for instance.
