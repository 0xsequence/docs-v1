# Getting Started: Signup and create a project in Builder

Signing up and creating a project is easy to do with Sequence Builder and should take you less than a minute. In this tutorial, we will help you sign up for Builder and then create your first project. 

Let's get started!


## Sign up for Builder

### Step 1: Go to sequence.build

Go to [Sequence.Build](https://sequence.build/) and click on the `Start Building` button to get started.

### Step 2: Choose a sign in method

When you first sign in to Builder, a wallet is created for you.

You may, however, already have a Sequence wallet. If you are signed in with that wallet, you will see an option to use it. This is a great way to get started.

Without a wallet, you will be given a few options to sign in. You can use any of the social sign ins, or you can simply use your email to get started.

### Step 3: Sign in to sequence.build

After choosing how you would like to sign in, you will be presented with the terms of use. To read the `Terms of Use`, `Privacy Policy`, and `Master Services Agreement`, click on the respective links for each.

Once you have read each, click through to continue.

You are now signed in to Builder!



## Create a Project

Everything you do in Builder is centered around each project - so let's start one.

The easiest way to start a project is to simply click `+ Create Project`.

### Step 1: Enter the project details

A modal will pop up, allowing you to enter details about your project. Provide a project name and, if you like, add an avatar for the project.

Select the network(s) on which you would like to start deploying. This can always be changed later.
