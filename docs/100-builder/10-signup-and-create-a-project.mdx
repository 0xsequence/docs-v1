# Getting started: sign-up and create a project

Signing up and creating a project is easy to do with Sequence builder and should take you less than a minute to do.

In this tutorial we will point you to the quickest way to get into builder (using social sign-in), and then show you how to sign-up using email and entering a confirmation code.

Then, from inside of builder, we will show you how to create your first project.

Lets get started!

## Step 1: Go to sequence.build

Start by going to [Sequence.Build](https://sequence.build/)

It's easy to get distracted here, but it may be worth it to you to read over some of the features.

## Step 2: Select "Start Building"

Once you're finished - click the `Start Building` button.

## Step 3: Choose a sign-in method

When you first sign-in to builder, a wallet is created for you.

You may have already have created a sequence wallet - if you are signed in to that wallet already, you will see an option to use that wallet. This is a great way to get started.

But for this walkthrough, let's assume you do not already have a wallet created. Hit `Start Building` and you will be given a few options to sign-in with.

### sign-in with social

The simplest way is to use your preferred social sign-in. In addition to the main selection, you can see more options by clicking the `Show More Options` button.

If you use a social login, skip ahead to step 4.

### sign-in with email

Since email can be a little more involved, lets cover it briefly. When you give your email, a confirmation code will be given to you on your wallet. In your email you will find a link to follow where you can enter your code.

Start by entering your email.

Then take the confirmation code it gives you.

Open the link in your email, and enter the confirmation code.


![Sequence builder enter code](/img/builder/builder_enter_code_signup_project.png)

When the correct code is entered, it will instruct you to return to the sequence.build page.

The page should now be asking you to read and accept terms of use.


## Step 4: Read and accept terms of use

Click on each link to read the `Terms of Use`, `Privacy Policy`, and `Master Services Agreement`.

Once you have read each, click through to continue.

## Step 5: Sign-in to sequence.build

You are now signed-in to builder!

Since everything you do in builder is centered around each project, there is not a whole lot you can do with out one - so lets get one started.

The main way to get started is to simply click `+ Create Project`

But another way is to start by looking up an existing contract. To try that, click `Search Web3` button, and you will be given a place to search for contracts.

For this walkthrough though, we are going to create a project without a smart contract first - so return to the dashboard and click `+ Create Project`

## Step 5: Enter the project details


A modal will pop up where you can enter details on your project. Enter a project name, and add an avatar for the project if you like.

Select which networks you would like to start deploying on. This can always be changed later.

## Step 6: Create the project!

Now hit the `Create new Project` button!

To finish, you should now be looking at your project dashboard. So much that you can do from here! Enjoy.
