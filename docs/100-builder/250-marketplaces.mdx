# Marketplaces in Builder

Sequence Builder provides game builders with a white-label marketplace that can be launched in seconds. With Builder, you can customize your marketplace and integrate it directly into your game experience.

##### Why would I want my own Marketplace for my web3 game?
Builder gives you full control over everything in your marketplace, from enforcing royalties (with ERC-2981) to choosing the best trading mechanism for your community, setting fees, and more. You can also aggregate listings from major platforms like OpenSea or LooksRare, providing you with the benefit of existing liquidity without relinquishing control of the gaming experience.

Speaking of the gaming experience, you can customize your integration to place your marketplace anywhere within your players' game journey. You can even take it a step further by utilizing marketplace APIs to craft a dynamic gaming experience that responds to marketplace activity.

##### What kind of customization can I do?
Being able to seamlessly integrate your marketplace into your gaming experience means players never even have to leave the game to use the marketplace. Use all the custom layouts and design elements you need for your experience and brand. In addition to the embedding options, you can also host your marketplace on its own URL, giving you even more flexibility to craft the best experience possible.
