# Welcome to Wallet SDK's in Builder
Sequence Builder offers multiple options for integrating Sequence Wallet into your project. You can use SequenceKit to connect a Sequence Wallet or choose one of our SDKs.

##### How can I integrate a Wallet into my game with these options?
With SequenceKit, you can utilize the interface within this Builder section. Simply input the wallet details, such as networks and authentication preferences, then click 'save.' The interface will generate the necessary code and present it to you as a code snippet. For additional information and the next steps, watch the tutorial below.

When utilizing our SDKs, you have a few options. The first SDK choice involves using a Web SDK. Similar to the SequenceKit option, you can input specific details and receive a code snippet for your wallet.

The Next option is to utilize either the Unreal SDK or Unity SDK. Please note that neither is currently live, but both will be available soon.

##### What are the differences between these options?
All these options offer non-custodial smart contract wallets with account abstraction features you expect.

SequenceKit is wallet connector. You start by creating a Sequence Wallet, then you integrate SequenceKit into it. Integrating through SequenceKit comes with a few useful benefits.

Web SDK

The Unity SDK integrates Wallet & Indexer functionality into games developed with the Unity Engine. Similarly, the Unreal SDK is an integration for games built with the Unreal Engine.

##### What the benefits of each option and how can I leverage these benefits?
All of these options also come with a couple of benefits for all our smart contract wallets, like email or social account logins and gas sponsoring and relayer options.

SequenceKit offers some unique benefits. As a connector, it supports other web3 wallets. By leveraging you can cater to both existing wallet holders and millions of potential new users. SequenceKit also provides embedded wallet views so that users donâ€™t need to leave the game or app.

Web SDK

Unity SDK and Unreal SDK give you the advantages of integrating a Sequence Wallet directly into the game.
