## Settings Options

The Settings section in Sequence Builder is categorized into five smaller sections:
1. **General**: Update your [project name](/builder/settings#project-name) or [avatar](/builder/settings#avatar)
2. **Collaborators**: Add [collaborators](/builder/settings#add-a-collaborator) or create [invite links](/builder/settings#create-an-invite-link)
3. **Networks**: Update the [networks](/builder/settings#3-network-settings) your project is using
4. **API Access Keys**: Create [new keys](/builder/settings#create-a-new-api-access-key) and [configure existing keys](/builder/settings#update-api-access-settings-of-a-key)
5. **Billing**: Update your [project plan](/builder/settings#update-your-project-subscription-plan) or set [overage limits](/builder/settings#set-your-overage-limit)

The final action you can take in settings is to [delete your project](/builder/settings#delete-a-project).

Settings are configured per project, so let's start by navigating to the settings of a specific project.
