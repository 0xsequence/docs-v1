# How to Sponsor Gas for a Contract in Builder

Sponsoring gas for your web3 game enhances the player's experience, encourages in-game transactions, and reduces friction for onboarding new users.

In this walkthrough we will show you how to go into your gas tank and select a smart contract to sponsor gas on.

### Prerequisite: Create a Project and deploy a Smart Contract

This guide assumes that you have already [signed up for Builder and created a Project](https://docs.sequence.xyz/signup-and-create-a-project).

Before you can sponsor gas you will need to know what contract you want to sponsor. For this walkthrough we are using a contract that we have deployed in Builder. If you have not done so already, go back and follow [how to load an item collection through deploying a smart contract](/guides/deploy-an-item-collection-contract) first.


## Step 1: Go to the Gas Tank

Start by logging into [Sequence.Build](https://sequence.build/) and selecting the project that you want to sponsor gas in. On the project dashboard, you should see any smart contracts you have deployed. 

From here, navigate to the Gas Tank section.

## Step 2: Click add an address

Inside the Gas Tank section, you will see an option at the bottom to add addresses.

Click the `+ Add Addresses` button.

## Step 3: Select and Sponsor the Contract

There are a couple of methods to choose the smart contract you wish to sponsor. You can search for it by name or address below. However, if you have already deployed a contract within this project, it will be listed as an option at the top.

Choose the deployed contract by clicking the `Sponsor` button located to the right of it.

Once complete, you will return to the Gas Tank section. You can confirm your sponsored contract by checking if it is listed here.

## More options: Pause a Sponsor

After setting up a sponsor, you'll have a few options available for managing it.

To access the sponsor settings, click the `âš™` button located on the right side.


![Sequence builder edit contract sponsor gas](/img/builder/builder_edit_contract_sponsor_gas.png)

In this modal, you have the options to modify the Display Name or pause the sponsor.

To pause, simply switch the Active toggle to the off position, and then click the `Update` button to save your changes.

Upon returning to the Gas Tank section, you can verify the status by checking if your sponsor's status now displays as `Disabled ðŸ”´`
