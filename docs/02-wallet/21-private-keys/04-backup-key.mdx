# Backup Key

:::info Feature in development
This feature is not yet available in Sequence Wallet, but is being actively worked on. 
ETA **Q1-Q2, 2022**.
:::

Users can add a backup key to their wallet, which will have enough signing power to perform any transaction. This key will only be shown once and can be added by users concerned about losing access to other keys in the system.

[Web3 Login](web3-login) users are forced to add a backup key for improved security, but this option is also available for users using a Torus key.
