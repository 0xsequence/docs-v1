# Universal Deployer

The Sequence contract wallets use [Nick's method](https://weka.medium.com/how-to-send-ether-to-11-440-people-187e332566b7) to deploy the contracts that compose the smart contract wallet.
This method has been chosen because it allows each wallet to take the same address on multiple chains, making it easier to use and less prone to mistakes.

:::danger Limitations
Sequence wallets **may not** receive the same address on all EVM compatible chains.

Networks that implement only a subset of the EVM opcodes, or alternative virtual machines, will result in a different address for each chain.

**Double-check your addresses** before sending any assets to them.
:::

## Deploy process

The following steps are required to deploy the [Sequence context](#) on a new network.

:::info Notice
For most popular networks this process **is not** required; due to the wallet contracts being already deployed.

To see if a configuration already exists for a given chain go to [Networks](#).

### 1 - Deploy NanoUniversalDeployer

Pre-found Nick's method address with funds required to pay for the deployment of contracts.

```
Address: 0x9c5a87452d4FAC0cbd53BDCA580b20A45526B3AB
Funds: 0.02170000000014
```

**Do not send additional funds to the address, as funds can't be refunded.**

Once the address is funded, you can deploy the NanoUniversalDeployer by executing the following pre-signed transaction:

```
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
```

After the transaction is confirmed, you should see the address of the NanoUniversalDeployer:

```
NanoUniversalDeployer: 0x9c5a87452d4FAC0cbd53BDCA580b20A45526B3AB
```
