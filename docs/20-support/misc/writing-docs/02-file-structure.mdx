# File Structure

To Create a New File for the documentation name it `file-name.mdx`

On the top of the file we can add a section to define the sidebar_position, title,
tags and slug of the file.

```md
---
sidebar_position: <int> 
title: <string>
tags: 
    - <string>
    - <string>
slug: /<string> (optional)
---
```
`tags` help in seo as they are the meta data of that page, and help search engines understand what the page is for.

example:
```md
---
sidebar_position: 1
title: Introduction
tags:
    - introduction
    - Basics
    - index
    - home
--- 
```

When Creating a directory for a sub-category we need to add a file called `_category_.json`
With the contents:
```json
{
    "label": <string>,
    "position": <int>
}
```
> `label` is the title of the section <br/> `position` is the position of the section in the sidebar
