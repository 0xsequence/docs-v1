Onboard more users and let them spend faster.

No gas fees for your users combined with environmentally-friendly transaction relaying.

The Sequence Relayer lets you sponsor transactions, so that your users won’t pay gas, enabling a better user
experience, especially helpful for folks new to crypto.

The Relayer lets you batch transactions and even send batches of transactions in parallel, enabling higher throughput
while simultaneously saving you fees, time, and reducing your carbon footprint. Your users can batch as well, which means
they can send multiple asset types—coins (ERC20s), NFTs (ERC721s), and collectibles (ERC1155s)—all in a single transaction, saving them time and fees.

Sequence makes transacting easy for your users by displaying all transactions in a human-readable format, so your users
have confidence in the actions they’re performing.

Your users don’t need to worry about setting gas prices, gas limits, or stuck transactions. Sequence guarantees all
transactions are mined and confirmed in a reasonable timeframe.

* Relayer is a powerful transaction infrastructure layer built on Ethereum-compatible networks
* Easily build backend servers which can send transactions in batches and in parallel – allow many transactions to be mined simultaneously
* Easily build minting / token reward applications which are 10x faster and cheaper then sending transactions directly to a blockchain
* Quickly and cost-effectively airdrop tokens to your communities
* Sponsor transactions so your users don’t need to pay gas fees (better onboarding)
* Allows you to execute txns without worrying about gas prices, gas limits, or stuck txns
* Fire and forget transactions 
* Free to use / Sequence Pro gives you more reporting
