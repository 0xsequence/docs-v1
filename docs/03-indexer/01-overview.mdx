# Indexer

The Sequence Indexer is a modular Web3 service that makes it easy to query blockchain token
and NFT data from Ethereum-compatible networks. The Indexer **automatically indexes every
ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 token** from all Ethereum-compatible chains. The Indexer is
very fast, and tracks transactions in real-time.

In fact, the Sequence Wallet uses the Indexer behind the scenes so it can seamlessly
render all token information in any wallet. But of course, the Indexer is a modular piece
of infrastructure, and you may use it with any wallet, from your dapp, game, or even from
a server.

<br/>

**Example Blockchain Queries:**

Here are a few of the queries you can make to a blockchain from your dapp, game, or wallet: 

* [Fetch all tokens for any wallet address including all metadata](/blah)
* [Fetch the transaction history for any wallet address](/blah)
* [Fetch the transaction history for any token contract address](/blah)
* [Fetch all tokens which belong to a particular NFT contract](/blah)
* [What is the total token supply of an ERC20 token? What is the total token supply of
all the ERC1155 tokens in a particular contract ?](/blah)
* [Who are all the owners of tokens of a particular contract / project ?](/blah)

<br/>

**Features:**

The Indexer is specialy designed and has been iterated over the last few years during
the development of Skyweaver.net and Sequence.xyz, designed for Ethereum multi-chains,
and as a result has a number of unique features compared to other blockchain indexing
products in the market:

* Super-fast API to query all token balances, history, metadata and NFTs with multi-chain support
* Real-time indexing of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 transactions across EVM-compatible chains
* Automatically detects all tokens on the chain, without the need for a contract registry
* Resilient to node failures and chain re-organizations
* Easily listen for specific events and transactions on-chain accurately with a simple API
* Built-in token / nft metadata support to easily render tokens in your apps / games
* High uptime and availability
