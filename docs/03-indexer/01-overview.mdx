# Indexer

The Sequence Indexer is a modular Web3 service that makes it effortless to query blockchain token
and NFT data from Ethereum-compatible networks. The Indexer **automatically indexes every
ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 token** from all Ethereum-compatible chains. The Indexer is
very fast, and tracks blockchain updates in real-time.

In fact, the Sequence Wallet uses the Indexer behind the scenes so it can seamlessly
render all token information in any wallet. But of course, the Indexer is a modular piece
of infrastructure, and you may use it with any wallet, from your dapp, game, or even from
a server.

<br/>

**Example Blockchain Queries:**

Dapps and Games are also leveraging the Indexer directly to easily perform the
following kinds of common queries:

1. [List all tokens in my wallet including all metadata](/blah)
2. [List all tokens for any wallet address including all metadata](/blah)
3. [What is the total token supply of an ERC20 token? What is the total token supply of
all the ERC1155 tokens in a particular contract ?](/blah)
4. [Who are all the owners of tokens of a particular contract / project ?](/blah)

<br/>

**Features:**
* etc........... like chi......
* the Indexer is resilient to node failures and chain re-organizations.
* real-time ...........

<br/>

The Indexer is specialy designed and has been iterated over the last few years during
the development of Skyweaver.net and Sequence.xyz, designed for Ethereum multi-chains,
and as a result has a number of unique features compared to other blockchain indexing
products in the market:

The Sequence Indexer is available for free with moderate rate-limits, but if you require
