# Contract Deployment
While, in general, we would recommend deploying your smart contracts via the [Builder](https://sequence.build/), we recognize that there are some use cases where deploying a smart contract from Unity (or a Made-With-Unity application) is useful.

Contract deployment involves sending a transaction, which is done via an [asynchronous Task](https://medium.com/@sonusprocks/async-await-in-c-unity-explained-in-easy-words-571ebb6a9369). You can use `await` when calling `WaaSWallet.DeployContract` from within an async Task if you wish to obtain the `ContractDeploymentReturn` object directly. Or, you can take the recommended approach which is to setup handler functions for the `WaaSWallet.OnDeployContractComplete` and `WaaSWallet.OnDeployContractFailed` events and call the `WaaSWallet.DeployContract` method from anywhere (without await).

`WaaSWallet.DeployContract` is essentially a wrapper for a very special `WaaSWallet.SendTransaction` call and therefore, you can expect to still receive the `WaaSWallet.OnSendTransactionComplete` or `WaaSWallet.OnSendTransactionFailed` events in addition.

```
public void OnDeployContractCompleteHandler(SuccessfulContractDeploymentReturn result) {
    Address newlyDeployedContractAddress = result.DeployedContractAddress;

    // Do something
}

public void OnDeployContractFailedHandler(FailedContractDeploymentReturn result) {
    // Do something
}

public void OnWaaSWalletCreatedHander(WaaSWallet wallet) {
    wallet.OnDeployContractComplete += OnDeployContractCompleteHandler;
    wallet.OnDeployContractFailed += OnDeployContractFailedHandler;
}
```

To deploy a contract you'll need to first [compile your smart contract code into bytecode](https://medium.com/coinmonks/compiling-the-smart-contracts-8dcda8071638) and add the bytecode as a hexadecimal string in one of your C# scripts. 

To deploy a smart contract, you can use this code snippet:
```
string bytecode = "Here you'll paste your compiled bytecode"
_wallet.DeployContract(Chain.Polygon, bytecode);
```
