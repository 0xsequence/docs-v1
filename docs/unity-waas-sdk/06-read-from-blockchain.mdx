# Read from Blockchain 

Reading from the blockchain is done using Unity-Native implementation of our [Sequence Indexer](/indexer).

We recommend creating an instance of the [`ChainIndexer` class](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/blob/master/Assets/SequenceSDK/Indexer/ChainIndexer.cs). This will expose you to all the functionality offered by the [`IIndexer` interface](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/blob/master/Assets/SequenceSDK/Indexer/IIndexer.cs).

```
IIndexer polygonIndexer = new ChainIndexer(Chain.Polygon);
```

`ChainIndexer` is essentially a wrapper of the [`Indexer` static class](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/blob/master/Assets/SequenceSDK/Indexer/Indexer.cs) which is fully documented here: https://docs.sequence.xyz/unity-sdk/indexer/guides.
