:::

The Sequence Indexer is a modular web3 service that makes it easy to query blockchain token
and NFT data from Ethereum-compatible networks. The Indexer **automatically indexes every
ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 token** from Ethereum-compatible chains.

In fact, the Sequence Wallet uses the Indexer behind the scenes so it can seamlessly
render all token information in any wallet. But of course, the Indexer is a modular piece
of infrastructure, and you may use it directly from your dapp, game, or even from
a server.

**Features:**

- Super-fast API to query all token balances, history, metadata and NFTs with multi-chain support
- Real-time indexing of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 transactions across EVM-compatible chains
- Automatically detects all tokens on the chain, without the need for a contract registry
- Resilient to node failures and chain re-organizations
- Easily listen for specific events and transactions on-chain accurately with a simple API
- Built-in token / nft metadata support to easily render tokens in your apps / games
- High uptime and availability

## Supported Networks & Endpoints

You can see the [full list of supported networks here](/multi-chain-support).


## Getting Started

Here are a few example queries you can make to a blockchain from your dapp, game, or wallet:

- [Fetch all tokens & NFTS in any wallet including all metadata](/indexer/fetch-tokens)
- [Fetch the transaction history for any wallet address](/indexer/transaction-history)
- [Fetch all unique tokens in a particular ERC20/721/1155 contract, including total supplies](/indexer/unique-tokens)
- [What is the total token supply of an ERC20 token? What is the total token supply of
  all the ERC1155 tokens in a particular contract?](/indexer/unique-tokens)
- [Fetch the transaction history for any token contract address](/indexer/transation-history-token-contract)
