# Installation
1. Download [the latest release of the Sequence Unity SDK UnityPackage](https://github.com/0xsequence/web3-unity-sdk/releases)
2. Drag the `.unitypackage` file into your Unity game project & import the entire thing.
3. The Sequence Unity SDK currently depends on the [Vuplex Webview package](https://vuplex.com), so you'll need to purchase and import Vuplex for each build target your game supports.

Once you're set up, move on to [the Unity Wallet SDK docs](wallet/setup) or [the Unity Indexer SDK docs](indexer)
