# Nethereum

## Overview

[Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/) is C# library that provides an abstraction layer over Web3 RPC providers and data structures.
The Sequence Unity SDK provides full integration with Nethereum.

## Getting Started

To use Sequence with Nethereum, you'll need to create a `Nethereum.Web3.Web3` instance, and hook up the `SequenceWeb3Client`.
Use our Wallet prefab and get a reference to a Wallet instance, then it's as easy as

```csharp
var client = new SequenceWeb3Client(wallet, Chain.Polygon);
var web3 = new Nethereum.Web3.Web3(client);
```

With this `Web3` instance, you can do everything that your chain has to offer!
You can even switch blockchains using the standard `wallet_switchEthereumChain` call, or even more simply by doing

```csharp
client.chainID = Chain.Ethereum;
```

Or, keep reading the docs to find out how to do common tasks using the Nethereum interfaces!
