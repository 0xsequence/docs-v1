# Social Login

Sequence Wallet supports social login through multiple providers.

## WebGL

Social login is enabled by default! Have fun!

## All other platforms

Social login is disabled by default in the Unity SDK, but enabling it is easy.

Pick a URL protocol for your application's Sequence Social login support.
In our demo dapp, we've picked `demo-dapp-sequence`.
We recommend something with a `sequence` prefix or suffix, and that also includes a unique identifier for your game, to avoid conflicts with other games.

You'll need to then set up social login for your build target(s):

### iOS

1. Open the iOS Player Settings window (menu: Edit > Project Settings > Player Settings, then select iOS).
2. Select `Other Settings`, then scroll down to `Configuration`.
3. Expand the `Supported URL schemes` section, and add 1 to the size.
4. In the new `Element N` field, enter the URL scheme you've configured for Sequence Social login. For our demo dapp, that's `demo-dapp-sequence`

### MacOS

1. Open the Windows/Mac/Linux Player Settings window (menu: Edit > Project Settings > Player Settings, then select Windows/Mac/Linux).
2. Select `Other Settings`, then scroll down to `Mac Configuration`.
3. Expand the `Supported URL schemes` section, and add 1 to the size.
4. In the new `Element N` field, enter the URL scheme you've configured for Sequence Social login. For our demo dapp, that's `demo-dapp-sequence`

### Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

1. Open the UWP Player Settings window (menu: Edit > Project Settings > Player Settings, then select UWP).
2. Select `Publishing Settings` > `Protocol`.
3. In the `Name` field, enter the URL scheme you've configured for Sequence Social login. For our demo dapp, that's `demo-dapp-sequence`

### Android

1. In the Project window, browse to Assets > Plugins > Android.
2. If it doesn't already exist, create a new file and name it `AndroidManifest.xml`.
3. Paste the following XML into the file, or, if you already have one, add the new keys from this XML to it.

```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <manifest
     xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
     xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
   >
     <application>
       <activity
         android:name="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity"
         android:theme="@style/UnityThemeSelector"
       >
         <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
         </intent-filter>
         <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
           <data android:scheme="demo-dapp-sequence" android:host="mobile.skyweaver.net" /> <!-- here is where you'll subsititute your social login URL scheme, but make sure to leave host="mobile.skyweaver.net"! -->
         </intent-filter>
       </activity>
     </application>
   </manifest>
```

### Native Windows (non-UWP)

No additional setup is required for Native Windows.
