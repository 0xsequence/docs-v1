# Further Interactions

For more complex on-chain interactions, you can use anything available in Nethereum.
Visit [the Nethereum documentation](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/introduction/web3/\) for a complete reference.
If you need a Sequence-specific feature that isn't documented here, you can use the [escape hatch technique](/unity-sdk/wallet/escape-hatch) with any code from the [sequence.js docs.](/wallet)

Finally, we've provided a few useful ABIs for you to interact with - ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155. Keep reading to see their interfaces.
