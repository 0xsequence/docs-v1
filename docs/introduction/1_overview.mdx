Sequence gives you a friendly, non-custodial wallet for your users with multi-chain support and seamless integration.

[SEQUENCE SCREENSHOTS]

Most wallets for Ethereum have a single private key that has full control over a wallet, i.e. an Externally Owned Account (EOAs). However, a Sequence wallet is a Smart Contract that is deployed on the blockchain and which can be controlled by multiple private keys. These keys are meant to be controlled by the wallet owner and provide added security since more than one of these keys would need to be compromised for the wallet to be compromised.
