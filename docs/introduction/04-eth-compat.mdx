# Ethereum Compatibility

One can communicate with Sequence the same way they would with other wallets like Metamask,
unless one wanted to have access to the more advanced features Sequence offers to its users.

You can use Sequence with all existing Ethereum web libraries such as [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
and [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/).
