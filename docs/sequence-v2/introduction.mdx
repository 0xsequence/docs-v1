# Introduction

This document describes the working principles of the Sequence v2 update; this is an incremental update with the primary objective of reducing the gas usage of the overall wallet system without compromising on security or decentralization.

Update pillars:

- Must not modify the core contracts
- Must be retro-compatible with existing wallets
- Must not depend on canned decentralized solutions
- Must reduce total gas usage of the system
