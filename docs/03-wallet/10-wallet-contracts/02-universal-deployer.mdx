# Universal Deployer

The Sequence contract wallets use [Nick's method](https://weka.medium.com/how-to-send-ether-to-11-440-people-187e332566b7) to deploy the contracts that compose the smart contract wallet.
This method has been chosen because it allows each wallet to take the same address on multiple chains, making it easier to use and less prone to mistakes.

:::danger Limitations
Sequence wallets **may not** receive the same address on all EVM compatible chains.

Networks that implement only a subset of the EVM opcodes, or alternative virtual machines, will result in a different address for each chain.

**Double-check your addresses** before sending any assets to them.

:::info Notice
A complete script for deployment can be found in the [Sequence Live Contracts repository](https://github.com/0xsequence/live-contracts).
:::

## Deploy Process V2

The following steps are required to deploy the [Sequence Wallet Context](./wallet-context) on a new network.

:::info Notice
For most popular networks this process **is not** required; due to the wallet contracts being already deployed.

To see if a configuration already exists for a given chain go to [Networks](/multi-chain-support#networks).

### 1 - Deploy Singleton Factory

The Singleton Factory is a contract that allows the deployment of a single contract instance per address. Unlike the 
[Universal Deployer](#universal-deployer), the Singleton Factory requires a salt to manage deployment instances. More information about the 
Singleton Factory can be found in the [EIP-2470 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2470).

The Pre-fund the Singleton Factory's deployer with the required funds to deploy the contract.

```
Address: 0xBb6e024b9cFFACB947A71991E386681B1Cd1477D
Funds: 0.0247
```

**Do not send additional funds to the address, as funds can't be refunded.**

Once the address is funded, you can deploy the Singleton Factory by executing the following pre-signed transaction:

```
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
```

After the transaction is confirmed, you should see the address of the Singleton Factory:

```
Singleton Deployer: 0xce0042B868300000d44A59004Da54A005ffdcf9f
```

### 2 - Deploy Wallet Context

Deploy each of the contracts in the [Sequence Wallet Context](./wallet-context) using the Singleton Factory.

A script can be found in the [Sequence Wallet Contracts repository](https://github.com/0xsequence/wallet-contracts/).

Clone the repository, configure the environment variables and run the script with:

```
yarn deploy <network>
```

## Deploy Process V1

The following steps are required to deploy the [Sequence Wallet V1 Context](./wallet-context) on a new network.

:::info Notice
For most popular networks this process **is not** required; due to the wallet contracts being already deployed.

To see if a configuration already exists for a given chain go to [Networks](/multi-chain-support#networks).

A complete code example of this deployment flow can be found in the [0xSequence.js test suite](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js/blob/91ed0df67fc5ddc47abf727ae8b94a8ca4f66912/packages/0xsequence/tests/browser/testutils/deploy-wallet-context.ts)

### 1 - Deploy NanoUniversalDeployer

Pre-found Nick's method address with funds required to pay for the deployment of contracts.

```
Address: 0x9c5a87452d4FAC0cbd53BDCA580b20A45526B3AB
Funds: 0.02170000000014
```

**Do not send additional funds to the address, as funds can't be refunded.**

Once the address is funded, you can deploy the NanoUniversalDeployer by executing the following pre-signed transaction:

```
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
```

After the transaction is confirmed, you should see the address of the NanoUniversalDeployer:

```
NanoUniversalDeployer: 0x9c5a87452d4FAC0cbd53BDCA580b20A45526B3AB
```

### 2 - Deploy UniversalDeployer2

In order to deploy contracts with an instance identifier, we need to deploy the UniversalDeployer2 contract. To ensure address consistency 
we use the UniversalDeployer contract to deploy the UniversalDeployer contract.

Send the following data to the UniversalDeployer deployed in the previous step.

```
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
```

After the transaction is confirmed, you should see the address of the UniversalDeployer2:

```
UniversalDeployer2: 0x8a5bc19e22d6ad55a2c763b93a75d09f321fe764
```

### 3 - Deploy Wallet Context

Compile and deploy the contracts in the [Sequence Wallet Context](./wallet-context) using the UniversalDeployer2.

Refer to the [0xSequence.js test suite](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js/blob/91ed0df67fc5ddc47abf727ae8b94a8ca4f66912/packages/0xsequence/tests/browser/testutils/deploy-wallet-context.ts) 
or [Wallet Contracts repository](https://github.com/0xsequence/wallet-contracts/blob/38e0719690eee3c4d7d8fa2ceff4ea22b0409f38/utils/deploy-contracts.ts) 
for the Wallet Contract context codebase.
