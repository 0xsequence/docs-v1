# Using Wagmi
The Sequence wallet used with Wagmi through the connector.

## Installation

The connector is installed via the npm package `@0xsequence/wagmi-connector`.

```js
npm install @0xsequence/wagmi-connector
```

## Usage

The connector is then imported and added to the list of connectors alongside the other wagmi connectors.

```js
import { SequenceConnector } from '@0xsequence/wagmi-connector'

  const connectors = [
    new SequenceConnector({
      chains,
      options: {
        connect: {
          app: 'Demo-app',
          networkId: 137
        }
      }
    }),
    ...otherConnectors
  ]
  
  const wagmiClient = createClient({
    autoConnect: false,
    connectors,
    provider
  })
```

## Parameters

### chains

### shimDisconnect (optional)

### options.connect (optional)
Connection details that will be passed to Sequence upon connection, including app name, network id, etc...
