# Fiat On-Ramps
Sequence Wallet allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies directly with their credit card and debit card via on-ramp providers. Currently Sequence supports 6 on-ramp providers;

- [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/)
- [Ramp](https://ramp.network/)
- [UPI via Onmeta](https://onmeta.in/)
- [Sardine](https://www.sardine.ai/)
- [PayTrie](https://paytrie.com/)
- [Wyre](https://www.sendwyre.com/) (deprecated)

Only providers that support the region the users are in will be displayed.

As a developer integrating the Sequence Wallet, you can choose which payment provider can be visible to users. You can also specify which token will be available to purchase via the on-ramp providers. 

To learn more on how to configure the on-ramp options, see [Sequence Connect Options](/wallet/guides/connect-wallet#includedpaymentproviders).
