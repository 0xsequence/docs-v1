# Using Web3-React V6

The connector is available for web3-react V6. Please note that later versions of web3-react cannot be used with the Web3-React V6 connector due to breaking changes.

## Installation

The connector may be installed via the npm package:

```js
 npm install @0xsequence/web3-react-v6-connector 0xsequence ethers
```

## Usage

### Initialization
The connector must be initialized similarly to other connectors.

```js
import { SequenceConnector } from '@0xsequence/web3-react-v6-connector'

const options = {
  appName: 'Web3 React Demo app'
}

export const sequence = new SequenceConnector({ chainId: 137, appName: options.appName  })
```

### Activation/Deactivation
The connection can be activated and deactivated from the initialized connector similarly to other connectors.

```js
import { useWeb3React } from '@web3-react/core'
import { sequence as sequenceConnector } from './connectors/sequence'

const { activate } = useWeb3React()

const connectWeb3React = async () => {
  activate(sequenceConnector);
}

const disconnectWeb3React = async () => {
  sequenceConnector.deactivate();
}
```

## Options
### chainId
The default chain id as number that the Sequence wallet will attempt to connect to.

### appName (optional)
The value of appName will be displayed by the Sequence wallet when initiating a connection.
