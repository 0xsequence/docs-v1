# Wallet Connectors

Sequence is compatible with all standard Ethereum libraries and connectors. If you've
developed your dapp to with work Metamask, it will also automatically work with Sequence.

Our SDKs offer all the functionality you'd need to build a web3 dapp, but you can also
combine other libraries, tools, and wallet connectors :) Please see our open sourced [Demo Dapp](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp)
project for an example use of Sequence, or see below on usage with additional connectors.

For your dapps, you may also want to support many different kinds of wallets in addition
to the Sequence Wallet. You may do this by using sequence.js or using one of the connectors below:

* [Sequence Kit](./kit)
* [Wagmi](./wagmi)
* [Web3Modal](./web3modal)
* [RainbowKit](./rainbow-kit)
* [web3-onboard](./web3-onboard)
* [web3-react](./web3-react-v6)

Additionally, if you are building a mobile app or video game, please see the docs for
the respective SDK. Feel free to reach out to our team for help/questions too.
