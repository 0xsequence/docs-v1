# Using RainbowKit

The Sequence wallet can be added to RainbowKit through the connector.

:::tip Try it live :)
Try [a live Dapp example](https://0xsequence.github.io/demo-dapp-rainbowkit/) using Sequence + Metamask + Rainbow + Wallet Connect with RainbowKit.

Source code is available too: [https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-rainbowkit](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-rainbowkit)
:::


## Installation

The connector is installed via the npm package `@0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin`.

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin 0xsequence ethers
```
or
```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin 0xsequence ethers
```

## Usage

The connector is then imported and added to the list of connectors alongside the other RainbowKit wallets.

```js
import { sequenceWallet } from '@0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin'
import { connectorsForWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

const connectors = connectorsForWallets([
  {
    groupName: 'Recommended',
    wallets: [
      sequenceWallet({
        chains,
        defaultNetwork: 'polygon',
        connect: {
          app: 'Demo-app'
        }
      }),
      ...otherRainbowKitWallets
    ]
  }

```

## Parameters

### chains
Chains supported by app. This is the same parameter as would be passed to other RainbowKit wallets.

### connect (optional)
Connect options for Sequence, including the name of the app and the default network id the wallet will attempt connection to.
A more in depth description of the connect options is available [here](/wallet/guides/connect-wallet#wallet-login-and-connect-options).

### defaultNetwork (optional)
The default network to connect to. Sequence will default all operations to this network. It can also be defined using a number (e.g. 1 for Mainnet, 5 for Goerli, etc...).

## Using NextJs
There are special considerations to take into account when using NextJs with Wagmi-based libraries like RainbowKit, such that it functions harmoniously with the server-side rendering of NextJs.
The correct technique to use differs depending on whether the application uses the older `pages` router or the more recent `app` router.

See [this section](https://docs.sequence.xyz/wallet/connectors/FAQ/#how-do-i-use-a-wallet-library-and-connector-with-nextjs-using-the-app-directory-version-13-and-above-only) for an explanation on using Wagmi or Wagmi-based libraries with `app` router.  
See [the example app](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi-next/tree/use-client-method) which uses the `app` router structure.  

See [this section](https://docs.sequence.xyz/wallet/connectors/FAQ/#how-do-i-use-a-wallet-library-and-connector-with-nextjs-using-the-pages-directory-all-versions-of-nextjs) for an explanation on using Wagmi or Wagmi-based libraries with `pages` router.  
See [the example app](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi-next/tree/mount-hook) which uses the `pages` router structure.  

## Using older versions of Wagmi (\<\= 0.12.x)
If you are using an older version of Wagmi (\<\= 0.12.x), which is based on ethers instead of viem, use the following command to install the appropriate version of the wagmi connector:

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/wagmi-connector@1.0 0xsequence ethers
```
or
```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/wagmi-connector@1.0 0xsequence ethers
```
