# Using RainbowKit

The Sequence wallet can be added to RainbowKit through the connector.

:::tip Try it live :)
Try [a live Dapp example](https://0xsequence.github.io/demo-dapp-rainbowkit/) using Sequence + Metamask + Rainbow + Wallet Connect with RainbowKit.

Source code is available too: [https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-rainbowkit](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-rainbowkit)
:::


## Installation

The connector is installed via the npm package `@0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin`.

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin 0xsequence ethers
```
or
```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin 0xsequence ethers
```

## Usage

The connector is then imported and added to the list of connectors alongside the other RainbowKit wallets.

```js
import { sequenceWallet } from '@0xsequence/rainbowkit-plugin'
import { connectorsForWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

const connectors = connectorsForWallets([
  {
    groupName: 'Recommended',
    wallets: [
      sequenceWallet({
        chains,
        connect: {
          app: 'Demo-app',
          networkId: 137
        }
      }),
      ...otherRainbowKitWallets
    ]
  }

```

## Parameters

### chains
Chains supported by app. This is the same parameter as would be passed to other RainbowKit wallets.

### connect (optional)
Connect options for Sequence, including the name of the app and the default network id the wallet will attempt connection to.
A more in depth description of the connect options is available [here](/wallet/guides/connect-wallet#wallet-login-and-connect-options).
