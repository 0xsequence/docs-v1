The Sequence wallet can easily be used with Web3Modal.

:::tip Try it live :)
Try [a live Dapp example](https://0xsequence.github.io/demo-dapp-web3modal/) using Sequence + Wallet Connect with Web3Modal.

Source code is available too: [https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-web3modal](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-web3modal)
:::

## Usage

The sequence wallet is compatible with wallet connect V2 and is therefore fully compatible with web3modal by default.
Users can use the Scan button in the sequence wallet to connect.
