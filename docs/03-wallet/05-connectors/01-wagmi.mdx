# Using Wagmi

The Sequence wallet used with Wagmi through the connector.

:::tip Try it live :)
Try [a live Dapp example](https://0xsequence.github.io/demo-dapp-wagmi/) using Sequence + Metamask + Wallet Connect with wagmi.

Source code is available too: [https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi)
:::


## Installation

The connector is installed via the npm package `@0xsequence/wagmi-connector`. If you are using the latest, viem-based, version of wagmi (>= 1.0.0) the package can be installed with the following command:

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/wagmi-connector 0xsequence ethers
```
or
```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/wagmi-connector 0xsequence ethers
```

If you are using an older version of Wagmi which is based of ethers (< 1.0.0), use the following command:

```shell
npm install @0xsequence/wagmi-connector@1.0 0xsequence ethers
```
or
```shell
yarn add @0xsequence/wagmi-connector@1.0 0xsequence ethers
```

## Usage

The connector is then imported and added to the list of connectors alongside the other wagmi connectors.

```js
import { SequenceConnector } from '@0xsequence/wagmi-connector'

  const connectors = [
    new SequenceConnector({
      chains,
      options: {
        connect: {
          app: 'Demo-app',
          networkId: 137
        }
      }
    }),
    ...otherConnectors
  ]
  
  const wagmiClient = createClient({
    autoConnect: false,
    connectors,
    provider
  })
```

## Parameters

### chains
Chains supported by app. This is the same parameter as would be passed to other RainbowKit wallets.

### options.connect (optional)
Connection details that will be passed to Sequence upon connection, including app name, network id, etc...
A more in depth description of the connect options is available [here](/wallet/guides/connect-wallet#wallet-login-and-connect-options).
