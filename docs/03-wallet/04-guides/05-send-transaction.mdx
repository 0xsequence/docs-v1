# Sending Transactions

Signing a transaction will only retrieve the signed payload.
If you want the wallet to actually dispatch the transaction to the network as well, that requires only a small modification to the previous example (note the change from `signTransactions` to `sendTransaction`):

```ts
const transaction = {
  to: recipientAddress,
  value: 1000000000000000000
}

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
const txnResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(transaction)
console.log(txnResponse)

// wait for the transaction to be mined
await txnResponse.wait()
```
