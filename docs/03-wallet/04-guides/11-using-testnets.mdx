# Using Sequence on testnets

By default, all Sequence wallets are able to use all supported networks (including testnets!). Dapps can interact with any of these testnets like they would with any other network.

For example, if a dapp only wants to interact with the Mumbai testnet, they can do so by specifying the network when `initWallet` is called:

```ts
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'

const wallet = await sequence.initWallet({ defaultNetwork: 'mumbai' })
```

Most methods also support a `chainId` parameter, which can be used to specify the network to interact with:

```ts
const signer = wallet.getSigner()

const transaction = {
  to: '0x6d52be8194216fF4E7685D285728C8dF9050b2CC',
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.1')
}

const response = await signer.sendTransaction(transaction, { chainId: 'mumbai' })
```
