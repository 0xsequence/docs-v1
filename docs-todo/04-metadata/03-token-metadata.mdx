# Token Metadata

..... TODO.. review / elaborate, etc.....

## Metadata Standards

### ERC20

ERC20's do not really have metadata standards, but we can infer information
from the methodso on the contract such as `name` and `decimals`. Additionally, OpenSea added something called `contractURI` (https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata).


### ERC721

ERC721 token contracts contain a method on the contract called `tokenURI(uint256) string`. When querying the `tokenURI` method on the contract, it will return a URI which contains additional metadata for that asset.

See EIP for specific details: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md

Here is an example Bored Ape (token id 9):
https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/mainnet/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/9

response:

```json
{
  "tokenId": "9",
  "contractAddress": "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d",
  "name": "",
  "description": "",
  "image": "https://ipfs.sequence.info/ipfs/QmUQgKka8EW7exiUHnMwZ4UoXA11wV7NFjHAogVAbasSYy",
  "decimals": 0,
  "properties": null,
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Earring",
      "value": "Silver Stud"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Eyes",
      "value": "Sleepy"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Mouth",
      "value": "Small Grin"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Fur",
      "value": "Brown"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Hat",
      "value": "Seaman's Hat"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Clothes",
      "value": "Stunt Jacket"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Background",
      "value": "Purple"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the case of this Bored Ape, it appears there is no name or description set,
but they do have "attributes" as an array of `{ "trait_type": string, "value: string }`.

Additionally, see OpenSea for more information: https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards

However note that OpenSea technically breaks the ERC1155 standard by suggesting to use "attributes", where in fact, the ERC1155 calls uses the field name "properties" instead of "attributes", see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#erc-1155-metadata-uri-json-schema (read section below). On Sequence Metadata, we support both structures for token contracts which use either format for their properties/attributes.

Another example is from Neon District: https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x7227e371540CF7b8e512544Ba6871472031F3335/158456331411102687640546264635


### ERC1155

ERC1155 token contracts contain a method on the contract called `uri(uint256) string`. When querying the `uri` method on the contract, it will return a URI which contains additional metadata for that asset.

See EIP for specific details: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#erc-1155-metadata-uri-json-schema

Here is an example Skyweaver card (token id 65548):
https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x27A11C1563a5dDa238379B95c91B3AbBaD9C0cf6/65548

```json
{
  "tokenId": "65548",
  "contractAddress": "0x27a11c1563a5dda238379b95c91b3abbad9c0cf6",
  "name": "Weighted Die (Silver)",
  "description": "Give +1/+1, armor, and guard to a random ally unit, six times.\n\n\"I will not bow to fate. If the dice fall against me, I'll cut off the hand that cast them.\"\n -Horik",
  "image": "https://assets.skyweaver.net/LV7xNcQh/webapp/cards/full-cards/6x/12-silver.png",
  "decimals": 2,
  "properties": {
    "artists": {
      "name": "Artist",
      "value": [
        {
          "id": "xavi",
          "name": "Henrique Xavier",
          "url": "https://www.artstation.com/kitexavier"
        }
      ]
    },
    "baseCardId": 12,
    "cardType": "Spell",
    "element": "Metal",
    "mana": 8,
    "prism": "Strength",
    "type": "Silver"
  },
  "attributes": null
}
```

As you can see, Skyweaver an ERC1155 token's metadata uses the `properties` object, which is an object/dictionary type of arbitrary data.
